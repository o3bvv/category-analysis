16033444,Redis in Action,Josiah L. Carlson,"Carlson, Josiah L.",,"=""1617290858""","=""9781617290855""",3,3.64,Manning,Paperback,320,2013,2013,,2020/10/15,,,read,"This book could be restructured into 2 major parts:<br/><br/>1) ""Redis data types with use-cases, performance, and scaling"".<br/>2) ""How to spend a lifetime building a scalable database on top of primitives and hope it will persist and debugging will be fun"".<br/><br/>And my guess everyone would like to see at least part #1 with examples of Redis commands instead of Python API calls. I already know Python and there's no need to spend extra time explaining to me what a decorator is and so on. It would be better to have an overview of concepts + examples of commands + overview of patterns & algorithms + tracing of data changes during application of them. Then performance, persisting, scaling, and fault-tolerance. And only after that should come overview of specific use-cases or solutions like building a sharded storage for Twitter with Redis (possibly as a separate part or as a series of appendixes). Instead, the whole book is a continuous ""unexpected journey"".<br/><br/>I really like the holistic and systematic approach across the book. I appreciate the efforts, smartness, and dedication of the author. Using Redis data structures can give a not-ordinary way to tackle certain problems and the book is full of practical examples on how to use them in non-obvious ways (or at least not so common ways) and how to consider and exploit certain technical nuances while designing a solution. The guy is really an expert in the domain, definitely knows what he's writing about and I really believe he applied all that in production successfully.<br/><br/>But the book would greatly benefit from a strong editorial review. The code samples in Python are far from being examples to follow. Moreover, they contain typos or seldom gaps. Following code from one chapter could require rereading and recomprehending code samples from several chapters back. The code is commented, but trying to follow comments can give a real headache. Just a bit of explanation: code does not have syntax highlights, there are no line numbers or just different even/odd background of lines. And comments look almost like code, but in a bolder font.  This itself is not a big issue, but comments for line 1 can be on the left side, comments for line 2 — on the right, and for line 3 — on the left again and co on. Moreover, comments are not aligned and can be arbitrarily displaced vertically or horizontally. And finally, lines and arrows between comments and target lines/tokens can be directed anywhere: top, bottom, left, right, etc. It can get very tricky and pretty quick to understand in what direction you should look even for a 10-lines sample. And oftentimes there are no examples of how data changes during the execution of code, which is really awful at places where temporary structures are created, like in the case of temporary ZSETs for multi-criteria sorting. And examples of functions' invocations are not always included, though.<br/><br/>I would recommend reading chapters 3, 4, 9, and 10 from this book, then study best practices (https://redislabs.com/redis-best-practices/introduction/) and take a look at modules (https://redislabs.com/modules/). After that one can get back to the rest of the chapters of this book and feel free to drop it as soon as one starts feeling sick.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

And it becomes more and more important to understand origins and rules of visual knowledge transfer, signaling and more to make information easily comprehensible and scannable by humans to prevent missing and loosing it in the void of digital cosmos.<br/><br/>This book is an amazing journey from rock paintings to modern typefaces, symbols, signals and beyond. It contains a thorough analysis of “anatomy” and “algebra” of visual means of information transfer accompanied by plentiful facts of history, tools, materials, human physiology and perception.<br/><br/>Just as languages are alive, ever-changing and adapting to the world, so are the means of speech and knowledge transfer. The book, while showing fundamentals, also invites its readers to use their intellect and imagination to come up with better solutions for the contemporary environment or even to create new ones for concepts and mediums non-existent before (which is a part of a daily job in software engineering, for example).<br/><br/>It’s hard to imagine the amount of effort put into this book and it’s definitely recommended for everyone interested in design, history, and cultures.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It’s a really hard thing to accomplish, as many factors from many disciplines has to be addressed, like psychology, physiology, biology, philosophy, cognitive science, design, knowledge engineering, math, cs, symbology, writing, indexing, and a way-way more. And then I’ve found this book — a magnificent excursion into a history of what people dreamed, though & done in that field, and what they devoted their lives to 40, 60, 100 years ago and beyond. This is unimaginable what was done in the past with compute powers many times less than of today’s cheapest “smart”-phones. It’s amazing to discover all that, read in an interesting and well-written language and to compare to awful crap we have nowadays. Recommend everyone",,,1,,,0,,,,,
