Finally, we reached the point that almost anything you could ever want could be sent to your home within days - even hours - of when you decided you wanted it.\r\n\r\nAmerica made that happen, but now America has lost interest in keeping it going.\r\n\r\nGlobe-spanning supply chains are only possible with the protection of the U.S. Navy. The American dollar underpins internationalized energy and financial markets. Complex, innovative industries were created to satisfy American consumers. American security policy forced warring nations to lay down their arms. Billions of people have been fed and educated as the American-led trade system spread across the globe.\r\n\r\nAll of this was artificial. All this was temporary. All this is ending.\r\n\r\nIn The End of the World is Just the Beginning, author and geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan maps out the next world: a world where countries or regions will have no choice but to make their own goods, grow their own food, secure their own energy, fight their own battles, and do it all with populations that are both shrinking and aging.\r\n\r\nThe list of countries that make it all work is smaller than you think. Which means everything about our interconnected world - from how we manufacture products, to how we grow food, to how we keep the lights on, to how we shuttle stuff about, to how we pay for it all - is about to change.\r\n\r\nA world ending.

These operative verbs abstract the idea of spatial formation to its most basic terms, allowing for an objective approach to create the foundation for subjective spatial design. Examples of these verbs are expand, inflate, nest, wist, lift, embed, merge and many more. Together they form a visual dictionary decoding the syntax of spatial verbs. The verbs are illustrated with three-dimensional diagrams and pictures of designs which show the verbs 'in action'.This approach was devised, tested, and applied to architectural studio instruction by Anthony Di Mari and Nora Yoo while teaching at Harvard University's Career Discovery Program in Architecture in 2010. As instructors and as recent graduates, they saw a need for this kind of catalogue from both sides - as a reference manual applicable to design students in all stages of their studies, as well as a teaching tool for instructors to help students understand the strong spatial potential of abstract operations.", "genres": [{"name": "Architecture", "slug": "architecture"}, {"name": "Design", "slug": "design"}, {"name": "Art", "slug": "art"}, {"name": "Reference", "slug": "reference"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Space", "slug": "space"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13592090-operative-design", "pages_n": 144, "pub_time": "2013-07-01T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2012-12-11T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "BIS Publishers", "book_isbn": "9063692897", "book_isbn13": "9789063692896", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "5813212", "name": "Anthony di Mari", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [{"id": "5813213", "name": "Megan Panzano", "role": "Author"}], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.14, "rating_count": 165, "rating_count_dist": [3, 4, 26, 66, 66], "reviews_count": 13}, "series": [], "links": null}

The Art of Seduction is a masterful synthesis of the work of thinkers  such as Freud, Ovid, Kierkegaard, and Einstein, as well as the achievements of  the greatest seducers throughout history. From Cleopatra to John F. Kennedy,  from Andy Warhol to Josephine Bonaparte, The Art of Seduction gets to the  heart of the character of the seducer and his or her tactics, triumphs and  failures. The seducer's many faces include: the Siren, the Rake, the Ideal  Lover, the Dandy, the Natural, the Coquette, the Charmer, and the Charismatic.  Twenty-four maneuvers will guide readers through the seduction process,  providing cunning, amoral instructions for and analysis of this fascinating,  all-pervasive form of power.

As Senge makes clear, in the long run the only sustainable competitive advantage is your organization\u2019s ability to learn faster than the competition. The leadership stories in the book demonstrate the many ways that the core ideas in The Fifth Discipline, many of which seemed radical when first published in 1990, have become deeply integrated into people\u2019s ways of seeing the world and their managerial practices. In The Fifth Discipline, Senge describes how companies can rid themselves of the learning \u201cdisabilities\u201d that threaten their productivity and success by adopting the strategies of learning organizations\u2014ones in which new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, collective aspiration is set free, and people are continually learning how to create results they truly desire.

It features a new Foreword about the success Peter Senge has achieved with learning organizations since the book\u2019s inception, as well as new chapters on Impetus (getting started), Strategies, Leaders\u2019 New Work, Systems Citizens, and Frontiers for the Future.

Such promises are implausible and potentially dangerous.\r\n\r\nAs Paris Marx shows, these technological visions are a threat to our ideas of what a society should be. Electric cars are not a silver bullet for sustainability, and autonomous vehicles won\u2019t guarantee road safety. There will not be underground tunnels to eliminate traffic congestion, and micromobility services will not replace car travel any sooner than we will see the arrival of the long-awaited flying car.\r\n\r\nIn response, Marx offers a vision for a more collective way of organizing transportation systems that considers the needs of poor, marginalized, and vulnerable people. The book argues that rethinking mobility can be the first step in a broader reimagining of how we design and live in our future cities. We must create streets that allow for social interaction and conviviality. We need reasons to get out of our cars and to use public means of transit determined by community needs rather than algorithmic control.

We call this imprisonment schooling, yet wonder why kids become bored and misbehave. Even outside of school children today seldom play and explore without adult supervision, and are afforded few opportunities to control their own lives. The result: anxious, unfocused children who see schooling\u2014and life\u2014as a series of hoops to struggle through.\r\n\r\nIn Free to Learn, developmental psychologist Peter Gray argues that our children, if free to pursue their own interests through play, will not only learn all they need to know, but will do so with energy and passion. Children come into this world burning to learn, equipped with the curiosity, playfulness, and sociability to direct their own education. Yet we have squelched such instincts in a school model originally developed to indoctrinate, not to promote intellectual growth.\r\n\r\nTo foster children who will thrive in today\u2019s constantly changing world, we must entrust them to steer their own learning and development. Drawing on evidence from anthropology, psychology, and history, Gray demonstrates that free play is the primary means by which children learn to control their lives, solve problems, get along with peers, and become emotionally resilient. This capacity to learn through play evolved long ago, in hunter-gatherer bands where children acquired the skills of the culture through their own initiatives. And these instincts still operate remarkably well today, as studies at alternative, democratically administered schools show. When children are in charge of their own education, they learn better\u2014and at lower cost than the traditional model of coercive schooling.\r\n\r\nA brave, counterintuitive proposal for freeing our children from the shackles of the curiosity-killing institution we call school, Free to Learn suggests that it\u2019s time to stop asking what\u2019s wrong with our children, and start asking what\u2019s wrong with the system. It shows how we can act\u2014both as parents and as members of society\u2014to improve children\u2019s lives and promote their happiness and learning.", "genres": [{"name": "Parenting", "slug": "parenting"}, {"name": "Education", "slug": "education"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Psychology", "slug": "psychology"}, {"name": "Childrens", "slug": "childrens"}, {"name": "Teaching", "slug": "teaching"}, {"name": "Family", "slug": "family"}, {"name": "School", "slug": "school"}, {"name": "Sociology", "slug": "sociology"}, {"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15843125-free-to-learn", "pages_n": 288, "pub_time": "2013-03-05T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2013-03-05T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Basic Books", "book_isbn": "0465025994", "book_isbn13": "9780465025992", "book_language": null, "primary_contributor": {"id": "8191360", "name": "Peter O.

The world is drowning in spy movies, TV shows, and novels, but universities offer more courses on rock and roll than on the CIA and there are more congressional experts on powdered milk than espionage. This crisis in intelligence education is distorting public opinion, fueling conspiracy theories, and hurting intelligence policy. In Spies, Lies, and Algorithms, Amy Zegart separates fact from fiction as she offers an engaging and enlightening account of the past, present, and future of American espionage as it faces a revolution driven by digital technology.\r\n\r\nDrawing on decades of research and hundreds of interviews with intelligence officials, Zegart provides a history of U.S. espionage, from George Washington\u2019s Revolutionary War spies to today\u2019s spy satellites; examines how fictional spies are influencing real officials; gives an overview of intelligence basics and life inside America\u2019s intelligence agencies; explains the deadly cognitive biases that can mislead analysts; and explores the vexed issues of traitors, covert action, and congressional oversight. Most of all, Zegart describes how technology is empowering new enemies and opportunities, and creating powerful new players, such as private citizens that are successfully tracking nuclear threats using little more than GoogleEarth. And she shows why cyberspace is, in many ways, the ultimate cloak-and-dagger battleground, where nefarious actors employ deception, subterfuge, and advanced technology for theft, espionage, and information warfare.\r\n\r\nA fascinating and revealing account of espionage for the digital age, Spies, Lies, and Algorithms is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the reality of spying today.", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Politics", "slug": "politics"}, {"name": "Espionage", "slug": "espionage"}, {"name": "Technology", "slug": "technology"}, {"name": "Military Fiction", "slug": "military-fiction"}, {"name": "War", "slug": "war"}, {"name": "Business", "slug": "business"}, {"name": "American History", "slug": "american-history"}, {"name": "Government", "slug": "government"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57813553-spies-lies-and-algorithms", "pages_n": 360, "pub_time": "2022-01-11T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2022-01-11T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Princeton University Press ", "book_isbn": "0691147132", "book_isbn13": "9780691147130", "book_language": null, "primary_contributor": {"id": "160703", "name": "Amy B.

Through his many books he developed a highly original form of systems theory that has been hugely influential in a wide variety of disciplines.\n\nIn Introduction to Systems Theory, Luhmann explains the key ideas of general and sociological systems theory and supplies a wealth of examples to illustrate his approach.

It not only represents an important intellectual step in discussions of art\u2014in its rigor and in its having refreshingly set itself the task of creating a set of distinctions for determining what counts as art that could be valid for those creating as well as those receiving art works\u2014but it also represents an important advance in systems theory.Returning to the eighteenth-century notion of aesthetics as pertaining to the \"knowledge of the senses,\" Luhmann begins with the idea that all art, including literature, is rooted in perception. He insists on the radical incommensurability between psychic systems (perception) and social systems (communication). Art is a special kind of communication that uses perceptions instead of language. It operates at the boundary between the social system and consciousness in ways that profoundly irritate communication while remaining strictly internal to the social.In seven densely argued chapters, Luhmann develops this basic premise in great historical and empirical detail. Framed by the general problem of art's status as a social system, each chapter elaborates, in both its synchronic and diachronic dimensions, a particular aspect of this problem. The consideration of art within the context of a theory of second-order observation leads to a reconceptualization of aesthetic form. The remaining chapters explore the question of the system's code, its function, and its evolution, concluding with an analysis of \"self-description.\"Art as a Social System draws on a vast body of scholarship, combining the results of three decades of research in the social sciences, phenomenology, evolutionary biology, cybernetics, and information theory with an intimate knowledge of art history, literature, aesthetics, and contemporary literary theory.

In this presentation of a general theory of systems, Germany's most prominent and controversial social thinker sets out a contribution to sociology that reworks our understanding of meaning and communication.Luhmann concedes that there is no longer a binding representation of society within society, but refuses to describe this situation as a loss of legitimation or a crisis of representation. Instead, he proposes that we search for new ways of coping with the enforced selectivity that marks any self-description under the conditions of functionally differentiated modern society. For Luhmann, the end of metanarratives does not mean the end of theory, but a challenge to theory, an invitation to open itself to theoretical developments in a number of disciplines that, for quite some time, have been successfully working with cybernetic models that no longer require the fiction of the external observer.Social Systems provides the foundation for a theory of modern society that would be congruent with this new understanding of the world.

It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary products or visionary market insights. Nor is it about just having a corporate vision. This is a book about something far more important, enduring, and substantial. This is a book about visionary companies.\" So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time.\n\nDrawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: \"What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?\"\n\nWhat separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for example, did Procter & Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world's best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked?\n\nBy answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies.\n\nFilled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.", "genres": [{"name": "Business", "slug": "business"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Leadership", "slug": "leadership"}, {"name": "Management", "slug": "management"}, {"name": "Entrepreneurship", "slug": "entrepreneurship"}, {"name": "Buisness", "slug": "buisness"}, {"name": "Self Help", "slug": "self-help"}, {"name": "Economics", "slug": "economics"}, {"name": "Personal Development", "slug": "personal-development"}, {"name": "Finance", "slug": "finance"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4122.Built_to_Last", "pages_n": 368, "pub_time": "2004-11-02T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1994-09-16T07:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Harper Business", "book_isbn": "0060566108", "book_isbn13": "9780060566104", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "2826", "name": "James C.

In Functional Training Anatomy, noted strength and conditioning specialists Kevin Carr and Mary Kate Feit cut through the clutter and misconceptions about functional training and cover all aspects of how to build a purposeful, effective, and efficient program that provides the strength, stability, and mobility you need to support your body in life and in sports.\n\nBeginning with a clear definition of what functional training entails, you will learn about the importance of mobility training and its impact on movement quality, performance, and injury reduction. Use the warm-up activities to prepare for high-intensity activities. Use the medicine ball and plyometric exercises to learn to produce and absorb force. Develop power with Olympic lifts, kettlebell swings, and jumping exercises. Improve strength in the upper body, lower body, and core with hip-dominant, knee-dominant, pushing, pulling, and core exercises.\n\nSee the inner workings of each of the exercises with superb full-color illustrations that show the primary and secondary muscles and connective tissue being used. The detailed instructions for these multiplanar and unilateral exercises ensure you execute each one correctly and safely. The Functional Focus element shows how the exercises translate to specific activities, whether that be an explosive athletic move or simply moving a box.\n\nFunctional Training Anatomy incorporates traditional and nontraditional exercises and mobility drills that will help you increase functional strength and reduce injury so your body is prepared to support the demands of athletic performance and daily living.\n\nCE exam available! For certified professionals, a companion continuing education exam can be completed after reading this book.

The first volumes were published the following year, but completion of the treatise required nearly two decades of dedication; Bourgery lived just long enough to finish his labor of love, but the last of the treatise's eight volumes was not published in its entirety until five years after his death.\n\nThe eight volumes of Bourgery's treatise cover descriptive anatomy, surgical anatomy and techniques (exploring in detail nearly all the major operations that were performed during the first half of the 19th century), general anatomy and embryology, and microscopic anatomy. Jacob's spectacular hand-colored lithographs are remarkable for their clarity, color, and aesthetic appeal, reflecting a combination of direct laboratory observation and illustrative research.

Stokker also cites details from wartime diaries of three other women from East, West, and North Norway. Placing the joking in historical, cultural, and psychological context, Stokker demonstrates how this seemingly frivolous humor in fact contributed to the development of a resistance mentality among an initially confused, paralyzed, and dispirited population, stunned by the German invasion of their neutral country.

The Golden Bough was originally published in two volumes in 1890, but Frazer became so enamored of his topic that over the next few decades he expanded the work sixfold, then in 1922 cut it all down to a single thick edition suitable for mass distribution. The thesis on the origins of magic and religion that it elaborates \"will be long and laborious,\" Frazer warns readers, \"but may possess something of the charm of a voyage of discovery, in which we shall visit many strange lands, with strange foreign peoples, and still stranger customs.\" Chief among those customs--at least as the book is remembered in the popular imagination--is the sacrificial killing of god-kings to ensure bountiful harvests, which Frazer traces through several cultures, including in his elaborations the myths of Adonis, Osiris, and Balder.  While highly influential in its day, The Golden Bough has come under harsh critical scrutiny in subsequent decades, with many of its descriptions of regional folklore and legends deemed less than reliable. Furthermore, much of its tone is rooted in a philosophy of social Darwinism--sheer cultural imperialism, really--that finds its most explicit form in Frazer's rhetorical question: \"If in the most backward state of human society now known to us we find magic thus conspicuously present and religion conspicuously absent, may we not reasonably conjecture that the civilised races of the world have also at some period of their history passed through a similar intellectual phase?\" (The truly civilized races, he goes on to say later, though not particularly loudly, are the ones whose minds evolve beyond religious belief to embrace the rational structures of scientific thought.) Frazer was much too genteel to state plainly that \"primitive\" races believe in magic because they are too stupid and backwards to know any better; instead he remarks that \"a savage hardly conceives the distinction commonly drawn by more advanced peoples between the natural and the supernatural.\" And he certainly was not about to make explicit the logical extension of his theories--\"that Christian legend, dogma, and ritual\" (to quote Robert Graves's summation of Frazer in The White Goddess) \"are the refinement of a great body of primitive and barbarous beliefs.\" Whatever modern readers have come to think of the book, however, its historical significance and the eloquence with which Frazer attempts to develop what one might call a unifying theory of anthropology cannot be denied. --Ron Hogan", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Mythology", "slug": "mythology"}, {"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Religion", "slug": "religion"}, {"name": "Anthropology", "slug": "anthropology"}, {"name": "Classics", "slug": "classics"}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}, {"name": "Reference", "slug": "reference"}, {"name": "Folklore", "slug": "folklore"}, {"name": "Spirituality", "slug": "spirituality"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18468252", "pages_n": 960, "pub_time": "2006-01-01T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1890-01-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "\u042d\u043a\u0441\u043c\u043e", "book_isbn": "5699167978", "book_isbn13": null, "book_language": "Russian", "primary_contributor": {"id": "1211478", "name": "James George Frazer", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.03, "rating_count": 8463, "rating_count_dist": [110, 445, 1738, 2979, 3191], "reviews_count": 387}, "series": [], "links": null}

In a disintegrating society, the masses become estranged from the leaders, and these then try to cling to their position by using force as a substitute for their lost power of attraction. The society splits up into a dominant minority, an internal proletariat, and an external proletariat consisting of the barbarians on its fringes. There is a corresponding psychological schism in the souls of people who happen to have been born into a disintegrating society. Discordant psychic tendencies which are perhaps always latent in human nature now find free play. People try to escape from an intolerable present into an idealized past or into an imaginary future.

I was led into this quest by finding myself dissatisfied with the present-day habit of studying history in terms of national states. These seemed, and still seem, to me to be fragments of something larger, and I found this larger and more satisfying unit of study in a civilization. The history of the United States, for instance, or the history of Britain, is, as I see it, a fragment of the history of Western Christendom or the Western Christian World, and I believe I can put my finger on a number of other societies, living or extinct, that are of the same species. Examples of other living civilizations besides the Western Civilization are the Islamic and the Civilization of Eastern Asia, centring on China. Examples of extinct civilizations are the Greco-Roman and the Ancient Egyptian. This practice of dealing in civilizations instead of nations is taken for granted by orientalists, ancient-historians, archaeologists, and anthropologists.

He has joined the pantheon that includes Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris, and Jackie Chan as one of the most famous martial artists of the twentieth century. Jiu-Jitsu, the fighting style developed and pioneered by his family, has become one of the world\u2019s most prominent martial arts, and Vale Tudo, the \u201canything goes\u201d style of Brazilian street fighting over which the Gracies had a monopoly, was an early precursor to the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Simply put, without the Gracie family, there would be no sport of \u201cMMA,\u201d no 4-billion-dollar UFC empire, and no \u201cBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu\u201d at strip malls all across America.\n\nIn Breathe, for the first time, Rickson will share the full story of how his father and uncles came to develop Jiu-Jitsu, what it was like to grow up among several generations of world-renowned fighters from the Gracie clan, and the principles and skills that guided him to his undefeated record. From learning to assert himself on the streets of Rio to gaining fame and honor in Japan and emerging through heartbreaking tragedy, the martial arts master shares tales of overcoming challenges, extolling universal virtues and showing readers how pride and ego are the enemies of success. \n\nWith never-before-seen photos and profound insights into the sport and way of life that only a studied legend can provide, Breathe is an entertaining and magnified view of an enduring legacy as well as an inspiring tale of weathering life\u2019s complexities and overcoming them with style and grace.", "genres": [{"name": "Biography", "slug": "biography"}, {"name": "Sports", "slug": "sports"}, {"name": "Martial Arts", "slug": "martial-arts"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Health", "slug": "health"}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}, {"name": "Audiobook", "slug": "audiobook"}, {"name": "Memoir", "slug": "memoir"}, {"name": "Spirituality", "slug": "spirituality"}, {"name": "Psychology", "slug": "psychology"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55893794-breathe", "pages_n": 288, "pub_time": "2021-08-10T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2021-08-10T07:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Dey Street Books", "book_isbn": "0063018950", "book_isbn13": "9780063018952", "book_language": null, "primary_contributor": {"id": "20288039", "name": "Rickson Gracie", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [{"id": "147703", "name": "Peter Maguire", "role": "Author"}], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.42, "rating_count": 2182, "rating_count_dist": [4, 31, 235, 679, 1233], "reviews_count": 170}, "series": [], "links": null}

It is also a book they may want to keep out of view of their professors, for it expresses in clear and simple language things that tend to be murky and abstruse in the classroom. These 101 concise lessons in design, drawing, the creative process, and presentation--from the basics of \"How to Draw a Line\" to the complexities of color theory--provide a much-needed primer in architectural literacy, making concrete what too often is left nebulous or open-ended in the architecture curriculum. Each lesson utilizes a two-page format, with a brief explanation and an illustration that can range from diagrammatic to whimsical. The lesson on \"How to Draw a Line\" is illustrated by examples of good and bad lines; a lesson on the dangers of awkward floor level changes shows the television actor Dick Van Dyke in the midst of a pratfall; a discussion of the proportional differences between traditional and modern buildings features a drawing of a building split neatly in half between the two. Written by an architect and instructor who remembers well the fog of his own student days,  101 Things I Learned in Architecture School provides valuable guideposts for navigating the design studio and other classes in the architecture curriculum.

Cooper details many of these meta functions to  explain his central thesis: programmers need to seriously re-evaluate the many user-hostile  concepts deeply embedded within the software development process. Rather than provide users with a straightforward set of options, programmers often pile on  the bells and whistles and ignore or de-prioritise lingering bugs. For the average user,  increased functionality is a great burden, adding to the recurrent chorus that plays:  \"computers are hard, mysterious, unwieldy things.\" (An average user, Cooper asserts, who  doesn't think that way or who has memorised all the esoteric commands and now lords it  over others, has simply been desensitised by too many years of badly designed  software.) Cooper's writing style is often overblown, with a pantheon of cutesy terminology (i.e.  \"dancing bearware\") and insider back-patting. (When presenting software to Bill Gates, he  reports that Gates replied: \"How did you do that?\" to which he writes: \"I love stumping  Bill!\") More seriously, he is also unable to see beyond software development's importance--a  sin he accuses programmers of throughout the book. Even with that in mind, the  central questions Cooper asks are too important to ignore: Are we making users happier?  Are we improving the process by which they get work done? Are we making their work  hours more effective? Cooper looks to programmers, business managers and what he calls  \"interaction designers\" to question current assumptions and mindsets. Plainly, he asserts that  the goal of computer usage should be \"not to make anyone feel stupid.\" Our distance from  that goal reinforces the need to rethink entrenched priorities in software planning. -- Jennifer Buckendorff, Amazon.com", "genres": [{"name": "Design", "slug": "design"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Business", "slug": "business"}, {"name": "Technology", "slug": "technology"}, {"name": "Programming", "slug": "programming"}, {"name": "Usability", "slug": "usability"}, {"name": "Software", "slug": "software"}, {"name": "Computer Science", "slug": "computer-science"}, {"name": "Technical", "slug": "technical"}, {"name": "Management", "slug": "management"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44098.The_Inmates_Are_Running_the_Asylum", "pages_n": 255, "pub_time": "2004-02-24T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1999-03-23T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Sams Publishing", "book_isbn": "0672326140", "book_isbn13": null, "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "16770", "name": "Alan Cooper", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 3.93, "rating_count": 2719, "rating_count_dist": [50, 155, 576, 1079, 859], "reviews_count": 191}, "series": [], "links": null}

In many industries, changes in products and technologies have brought with them new kinds of firms and forms of organization. We are discovering news ways of structuring work, of bringing buyers and sellers together, and of creating and using market information. Although our fast-moving economy often seems to be outside of our influence or control, human beings create the things that create the market forces. Devices, software programs, production processes, contracts, firms, and markets are all the fruit of purposeful action: they are designed. Using the computer industry as an example, Carliss Y. Baldwin and Kim B. Clark develop a powerful theory of design and industrial evolution. They argue that the industry has experienced previously unimaginable levels of innovation and growth because it embraced the concept of modularity, building complex products from smaller subsystems that can be designed independently yet function together as a whole. Modularity freed designers to experiment with different approaches, as long as they obeyed the established design rules. Drawing upon the literatures of industrial organization, real options, and computer architecture, the authors provide insight into the forces of change that drive today's economy.", "genres": [{"name": "Design", "slug": "design"}, {"name": "Software", "slug": "software"}, {"name": "Business", "slug": "business"}, {"name": "Engineering", "slug": "engineering"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/134515.Design_Rules_Volume_1", "pages_n": 484, "pub_time": "2000-03-02T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2000-03-02T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "MIT Press", "book_isbn": "0262024667", "book_isbn13": "9780262024662", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "77678", "name": "Carliss Y.

Strategic planning is essential. People's competencies should be measured and their weaknesses shored up. People crave feedback.These may sound like basic truths of our work lives today. But actually, they're lies. As strengths guru and bestselling author Marcus Buckingham and Cisco Leadership and Team Intelligence head Ashley Goodall show in this provocative, inspiring book, there are some big lies--distortions, faulty assumptions, wrong thinking--running through our organizational lives. Nine lies, to be exact. They cause dysfunction and frustration and ultimately result in a strange feeling of unreality that pervades our workplaces.But there are those who can get past the lies and discover what's real. These are freethinking leaders who recognize the power and beauty of our individual uniqueness, who know that emergent patterns are more valuable than received wisdom, and that evidence is more powerful than dogma. With engaging stories and incisive analysis, the authors reveal the essential truths that such freethinking leaders will recognize immediately: that it is the strength and cohesiveness of your team, not your company's culture, that matters most; that we need less focus on top-down planning and more on giving our people reliable, real-time intelligence; that rather than trying to align people's goals we should strive to align people's sense of purpose and meaning; that people don't want constant feedback, they want helpful attention. This is the real world of work.If you embrace each person's uniqueness and see this as key for all healthy organizations; if you reject dogma and engage with the real world; if you seek out emergent patterns and put your faith in evidence, not philosophy; if you thrill to the power of teams--if you do all of these, then you are a freethinking leader, and this book is for you.", "genres": [{"name": "Business", "slug": "business"}, {"name": "Leadership", "slug": "leadership"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Management", "slug": "management"}, {"name": "Self Help", "slug": "self-help"}, {"name": "Buisness", "slug": "buisness"}, {"name": "Psychology", "slug": "psychology"}, {"name": "Productivity", "slug": "productivity"}, {"name": "Audiobook", "slug": "audiobook"}, {"name": "Entrepreneurship", "slug": "entrepreneurship"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40086702-nine-lies-about-work", "pages_n": 256, "pub_time": "2019-04-02T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2019-05-01T07:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Harvard Business Review Press", "book_isbn": null, "book_isbn13": null, "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "18731", "name": "Marcus Buckingham", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [{"id": "18016101", "name": "Ashley Goodall", "role": "Author"}], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.14, "rating_count": 2788, "rating_count_dist": [32, 84, 470, 1075, 1127], "reviews_count": 340}, "series": [], "links": null}

We learn spatial schemas by observing the locations and movements of objects (including people) and the configuration of our environment.

Evidence suggests that we adapt spatial schemas for three basic purposes in abstract cognition: to structure memory, to structure communication, and to structure reasoning.\n\nAre spatial schemas mere metaphors that help us to understand cognitive processes or are they actual internal mechanisms? Evidence for the latter suggests that the cognitive structures we develop to perceive, navigate, and remember space are the indispensable foundation of more abstract cognitive tasks. This book proposes the means by which spatial structures might be adapted for nonspatial purposes, and it considers alternatives to spatial coding as a basis for abstract thought.\n\nThe book is organized into three parts: the representation and use of space, spatial schemas in cultural contexts, and the kinds of computational and neurological structures that might be involved in abstract thought.

The high priests of the profession worship the concept, while the iconoclasts of advocacy journalism, new journalism, and cyberjournalism consider objectivity a golden calf. Meanwhile, a groundswell of tabloids and talk shows and the increasing infringement of market concerns make a renewed discussion of the validity, possibility, and aim of objectivity a crucial pursuit.\n\nDespite its position as the orbital sun of journalistic ethics, objectivity--until now--has had no historian. David T. Z. Mindich reaches back to the nineteenth century to recover the lost history and meaning of this central tenet of American journalism. His book draws on high profile cases, showing the degree to which journalism and its evolving commitment to objectivity altered-and in some cases limited--the public's understanding of events and issues. Mindich devotes each chapter to a particular component of this ethic-detachment, nonpartisanship, the inverted pyramid style, facticity, and balance. Through this combination of history and cultural criticism, Mindich provides a profound meditation on the structure, promise, and limits of objectivity in the age of cybermedia.", "genres": [{"name": "Journalism", "slug": "journalism"}, {"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1499667.Just_the_Facts", "pages_n": 200, "pub_time": "2000-07-01T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1998-11-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "New York University Press", "book_isbn": "081475614X", "book_isbn13": "9780814756140", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "382182", "name": "David T.Z.

The result is this dictionary of universally used graphic symbols. Henry Dreyfuss designed this sourcebook to be as practical and easy to use as possible by arranging the symbol information within ingeniously devised sections: Basic Symbols represents a concise and highly selective grouping of symbols common to all disciplines (on-off, up-down, etc.). Disciplines provides symbols used in accommodations and travel, agriculture, architecture, business, communications, engineering, photography, sports, safety, traffic controls, and many other areas. Color lists the meanings of each of the colors in various worldwide applications and cultures. Graphic Form displays symbols from all disciplines grouped according to form (squares, circles, arrows, human figures, etc.) creating a unique way to identify a symbol out of context, as well as giving designers a frame of reference for developing new symbols.

Stephen Kosslyn offers step-by-step guidelines for creating graphs that convey data in clear and attractive ways. This is also a \"why it works\" book. Kosslyn, a noted psychologist, bases his recommendations on extensive research into how the brain perceives and processes visual information. As he demonstrates, an awareness of the connections between the eye and the mind can make all the difference when creating or reading graphs. In Elements of Graph Design, Kosslyn helps you determine the appropriate format for a graph based on the data to be presented and your purpose in presenting it. He then focuses on the nuts and bolts of graph construction - the framework, the labels, the use of color and texture. Dozens of examples of effective and ineffective graphs are described and dissected in light of what is known about human visual perception. The result: easy-to-follow, unambiguous graphs that virtually anyone can understand immediately. Elements of Graph Design is for anyone who creates graphs, whether by computer or by pencil and paper. It is for anyone who relies on graphs in school work, presentations, or business reports. It is for anyone who wants a better understanding of the graphs used by newspapers and magazines, politicians, and advertisers (Kosslyn includes a chapter on how graphs can be used to misrepresent data). Finally it is for anyone interested in the mechanics of perception, memory, and cognition that come into play not just when we read graphs, but in any visual encounter.", "genres": [{"name": "Design", "slug": "design"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4833705-elements-of-graph-design", "pages_n": 309, "pub_time": "1993-10-01T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": null, "book_publisher": "W.H.

Are there basic rules governing design that, when learned, will facilitate the creative process? These questions have been asked by artists, art historians, and art critics throughout the ages.Convinced that design was not purely instinctive, Jay Hambidge (1867\u20131924) spent much of his life searching for the technical bases of design. He found his answer in dynamic symmetry, one of the most provocative and stimulating theories in art history. Hambidge's study of Greek art convinced him that the secret of the beauty of Greek design was in the conscious use of dynamic symmetry \u2014 the law of natural design based upon the symmetry of growth in man and in plants. But Hambidge, who was not only a theoretician but also a practicing artist, did much more than analyze classical art and its principles of design: he worked out a series of root rectangles that the artist, using the simple mathematics supplied in this book, can easily follow and apply in his own work.Originally published as a series of lessons in Hambidge's magazine, The Diagonal, this engrossing book explains all the basic principles of dynamic symmetry. Part I sets forth the fundamental rectangles with their simple divisions based on the proportioning law found in nature; Part II explains compound rectangles, many of which were taken from or suggested by analysis of objects of Greek art.

Can one find a natural aesthetic that corresponds to a universal order? If so, what importance can it have for the scientist, artist, or layman? What is the \"true\" significance of the triangle, rectangle, spiral, and other geometric shapes? These are but a few of the questions that Professor Matila Ghyka deals with in this fascinating book. The author believes that there are such things as \"The Mathematics of Life\" and \"The Mathematics of Art,\" and that the two coincide. Using simple mathematical formulas, most as basic as Pythagoras' theorem and requiring only a very limited knowledge of mathematics, Professor Ghyka shows the fascinating relationships between geometry, aesthetics, nature, and the human body.Beginning with ideas from Plato, Pythagoras, Archimedes, Ockham, Kepler, and others, the author explores the outlines of an abstract science of space, which includes a theory of proportions, an examination of \"the golden section,\" a study of regular and semi-regular polyhedral, and the interlinking of these various shapes and forms. He then traces the transmission of this spatial science through the Pythagorean tradition and neo-Pythagorism, Greek, and Gothic canons of proportion, the Kabbala, Masonic traditions and symbols, and modern applications in architecture, painting, and decorative art. When we judge a work of art, according to his formulation, we are making it conform to a pattern whose outline is laid down in simple geometrical figures; and it is the analysis of these figures both in art and nature that forms the core of Professor Ghyka's book. He also shows this geometry at work in living organisms. The ample illustrations and figures give concrete examples of the author's analysis: the Great Pyramid and tomb of Rameses IV, the Parthenon, Renaissance paintings and architecture, the work of Seurat, Le Corbusier, and flowers, shells, marine life, the human face, and much more.For the philosopher, scientist, archaeologist, art historian, biologist, poet, and artist as well as the general reader who wants to understand more about the fascinating properties of numbers and geometry, and their relationship to art and life, this is a thought-provoking book.", "genres": [{"name": "Art", "slug": "art"}, {"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}, {"name": "Mathematics", "slug": "mathematics"}, {"name": "Geometry", "slug": "geometry"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}, {"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Design", "slug": "design"}, {"name": "Architecture", "slug": "architecture"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85694.The_Geometry_of_Art_and_Life", "pages_n": 208, "pub_time": "1977-06-01T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1946-01-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Dover Publications", "book_isbn": "0486235424", "book_isbn13": "9780486235424", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "48994", "name": "Matila Ghyka", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.08, "rating_count": 133, "rating_count_dist": [2, 5, 31, 38, 57], "reviews_count": 8}, "series": [], "links": null}

Structurally sound aircraft  plummet to the earth, supertankers run aground in calm weather, and the  machines of medical science maim unsuspecting patients - - all because  designers sometimes fail to reflect the characteristics of the user in  their designs.  Designers and the public alike are realizing that  many human' errors are more aptly named designed-induced' errors.  Most  consumers experience the frustration of using many new products;  amusing stories about programming a VCR, operating a personal computer,  or finding the headlight switch on a rental car are heard in everyday  conversation.  The problems consumers experience with modern everyday  things are shared by the users of large-scale technologies where the  consequences of design can go well beyond simple matters of  inconvenience or amusement.  In the new second edition of Set  Phasers on Stun' and Other True Tales of Design, Technology, and Human  Error, noted designer and author Steven Casey has assembled 20 factual  and arresting stories about people and their attempts to use modern  technological creations.  Although the operator or pilot usually gets  blamed for a big disaster, the root cause can frequently be found in  subtle characteristics of the device's human interface.' Technological  disasters can often be traced directly to the interplay between people  and the design of a device - - be it an airliner cockpit, the controls  in an industrial plant, a spacecraft's instruments, a medical system, a  nuclear reactor, or even a commercial dishwashing machine.", "genres": [{"name": "Design", "slug": "design"}, {"name": "Engineering", "slug": "engineering"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Technology", "slug": "technology"}, {"name": "Psychology", "slug": "psychology"}, {"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}, {"name": "Academic", "slug": "academic"}, {"name": "Technical", "slug": "technical"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1066702.Set_Phasers_on_Stun", "pages_n": 251, "pub_time": "1998-01-01T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1993-07-01T07:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Aegean", "book_isbn": "0963617885", "book_isbn13": "9780963617880", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "176518", "name": "Steven Casey", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.06, "rating_count": 359, "rating_count_dist": [4, 10, 78, 136, 131], "reviews_count": 35}, "series": [], "links": null}

The concept of error, according to the author of Design Paradigms, is central to the design process. As a way of explaining the enduring aspects of engineering design, Henry Petroski relates stories of some of the greatest engineering successes and failures of all time. These case studies, drawn from a wide range of times and places, from Ancient Greece and Rome to modern America, serve as paradigms of error and judgment in engineering design. By showing how errors were introduced in the design process and how they might be avoided, the book suggests how better quality and reliability might be achieved in designed devices, structures, and systems of all kinds. Clearly written, with striking illustrations, the book will appeal to engineering students, practicing engineers, historians of science and technology, and all those interested in learning about the process of design.", "genres": [{"name": "Engineering", "slug": "engineering"}, {"name": "Design", "slug": "design"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Computer Science", "slug": "computer-science"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16247.Design_Paradigms", "pages_n": 224, "pub_time": "1994-06-30T07:00:00.292", "pub_first": "1994-05-27T07:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "book_isbn": "0521466490", "book_isbn13": "9780521466493", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "10019", "name": "Henry Petroski", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 3.92, "rating_count": 84, "rating_count_dist": [1, 4, 19, 37, 23], "reviews_count": 8}, "series": [], "links": null}

Conway Morris is one of the few paleontologists ever to explore the Burgess Shale, having been involved in the dig since 1972, and thus he is an ideal guide to this amazing discovery. Indeed, he provides a complete overview of this remarkable find, ranging from an informative, basic discussion of the origins of life and animals on earth, to a colorful description of Charles Walcott's discovery of the Burgess Shale and of the painstaking scientific work that went on there (as well as in Burgess collections held at Harvard and the Smithsonian), to an account of similar fossil finds in Greenland and in China. The heart of the book is an imaginative trip in a time machine, back to the Cambrian seas, where the reader sees first-hand the remarkable diversity of life as it existed then. And perhaps most important, Conway Morris examines the lessons to be learned from the Burgess Shale, especially as they apply to modern evolutionary thinking. In particular, he critiques the ideas of Stephen Jay Gould, whose best-selling book Wonderful Life drew on Conway Morris's Burgess Shale work. The author takes a fresh look at the evidence and draws quite different conclusions from Gould on the nature of evolution.  This finely illustrated volume takes the reader to the forefront of paleontology as it provides fresh insights into the nature of evolution and of life on earth.", "genres": [{"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}, {"name": "Biology", "slug": "biology"}, {"name": "Evolution", "slug": "evolution"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Palaeontology", "slug": "palaeontology"}, {"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Natural History", "slug": "natural-history"}, {"name": "Nature", "slug": "nature"}, {"name": "Geology", "slug": "geology"}, {"name": "Animals", "slug": "animals"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295369.The_Crucible_of_Creation", "pages_n": 276, "pub_time": "2000-01-13T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": null, "book_publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "book_isbn": "0192862022", "book_isbn13": "9780192862020", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "123676", "name": "Simon Conway Morris", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 3.97, "rating_count": 180, "rating_count_dist": [1, 5, 42, 82, 50], "reviews_count": 15}, "series": [], "links": null}

Our technology goes around on wheels\u2014and on rotating pulleys, gears, shafts, and cams\u2014yet in nature only the tiny propellers of bacteria spin as true wheels. Our hinges turn because hard parts slide around each other, whereas nature's hinges (a rabbit's ear, for example) more often swing by bending flexible materials.

This is the most influential force in your life, yet you are virtually unaware of it. Once you become aware of your personal time zone, you can begin to see and manage your life in exciting new ways.  In The Time Paradox, Drs. Zimbardo and Boyd draw on thirty years of pioneering research to reveal, for the first time, how your individual time perspective shapes your life and is shaped by the world around you. Further, they demonstrate that your and every other individual's time zones interact to create national cultures, economics, and personal destinies.  You will discover what time zone you live in through Drs. Zimbardo and Boyd's revolutionary tests. Ask yourself: \u2022 Does the smell of fresh-baked cookies bring you back to your childhood?  \u2022 Do you believe that nothing will ever change in your world?  \u2022 Do you believe that the present encompasses all and the future and past are mere abstractions?  \u2022 Do you wear a watch, balance your checkbook, and make to-do lists -- every day?  \u2022 Do you believe that life on earth is merely preparation for life after death?  \u2022 Do you ruminate over failed relationships?  \u2022 Are you the life of every party -- always late, always laughing, and always broke?  These statements are representative of the seven most common ways people relate to time, each of which, in its extreme, creates benefits and pitfalls. The Time Paradox is a practical plan for optimizing your blend of time perspectives so you get the utmost out of every minute in your personal and professional life as well as a fascinating commentary about the power and paradoxes of time in the modern world.  No matter your time perspective, you experience these paradoxes. Only by understanding this new psychological science of time zones will you be able to overcome the mental biases that keep you too attached to the past, too focused on immediate gratification, or unhealthily obsessed with future goals. Time passes no matter what you do -- it's up to you to spend it wisely and enjoy it well.

It is a must-have resource for both experienced students of mythology and the explorer just beginning to approach myth as a source of knowledge.", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Mythology", "slug": "mythology"}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}, {"name": "Psychology", "slug": "psychology"}, {"name": "Writing", "slug": "writing"}, {"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Religion", "slug": "religion"}, {"name": "Classics", "slug": "classics"}, {"name": "Anthropology", "slug": "anthropology"}, {"name": "Spirituality", "slug": "spirituality"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/588138.The_Hero_With_a_Thousand_Faces", "pages_n": 416, "pub_time": "1972-03-01T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1949-06-10T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Princeton University Press", "book_isbn": "0691017840", "book_isbn13": "9780691017846", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "20105", "name": "Joseph Campbell", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.13, "rating_count": 38170, "rating_count_dist": [851, 1846, 5925, 12339, 17209], "reviews_count": 2599}, "series": [], "links": null}

Yet, few companies really know how brand meaning works, how to manage it, and how to use brand meaning strategically. Written by best-selling author Carol S. Pearson (The Hero Within) and branding guru Margaret Mark, this groundbreaking book provides the illusive and compelling answer. Using studies drawn from the experiences of Nike, Marlboro, Ivory and other powerhouse brands, the authors show that the most successful brands are those that most effectively correspond to fundamental patterns in the unconscious mind known as archetypes. The book provides tools and strategies to: - Implement a proven system for identifying the most appropriate and leverageable archetypes for any company and/or brand - Harness the power of the archetype to align corporate strategy to sustain competitive advantage", "genres": [{"name": "Business", "slug": "business"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Psychology", "slug": "psychology"}, {"name": "Design", "slug": "design"}, {"name": "Writing", "slug": "writing"}, {"name": "Entrepreneurship", "slug": "entrepreneurship"}, {"name": "Art Design", "slug": "art-design"}, {"name": "Buisness", "slug": "buisness"}, {"name": "Reference", "slug": "reference"}, {"name": "Communication", "slug": "communication"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/357638.The_Hero_and_the_Outlaw", "pages_n": 400, "pub_time": "2001-02-06T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2001-01-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "McGraw-Hill Companies", "book_isbn": "0071364153", "book_isbn13": "9780071364157", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "204877", "name": "Margaret Mark", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [{"id": "28568", "name": "Carol S.

From the explosions of image and color in In The Shadow of the Sun, The Last of England, The Garden and Wittgenstein, to the somber blacks of his collages and tar paintings, Jarman has consistently used color in unprecedented ways, making his ideas on the subject of interest to filmmakers, film audiences, artists and students alike. Blue, his most personal and innovative film, consists of a compelling soundtrack accompanied by a monochrome blue image and is, among other things, a comment on Jarman's diminishing eyesight due to AIDS. In his signature style, a lyrical combination of classical theory, anecdote, and poetry, Jarman takes the reader through the spectrum, introducing each color as an embodiment of an emotion, evoking memories or dreams. He explains the use of color in Medieval painting through the Renaissance to the modernists and draws on the great color theorists from Pliny to Leonardo. He writes too about the meanings of color in literature, science, philosophy, psychology, religion and alchemy. Read either as a work on color, or a distillation of Jarman's artistic vision, Chroma presents an exciting perspective on the subject.", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Art", "slug": "art"}, {"name": "LGBT", "slug": "lgbt"}, {"name": "Poetry", "slug": "poetry"}, {"name": "Design", "slug": "design"}, {"name": "Queer", "slug": "queer"}, {"name": "Memoir", "slug": "memoir"}, {"name": "Film", "slug": "film"}, {"name": "Art Design", "slug": "art-design"}, {"name": "Biography", "slug": "biography"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/587275.Chroma", "pages_n": 240, "pub_time": "1996-10-01T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1994-01-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Overlook Books", "book_isbn": "0879516798", "book_isbn13": "9780879516796", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "30028", "name": "Derek Jarman", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.31, "rating_count": 603, "rating_count_dist": [2, 15, 87, 192, 307], "reviews_count": 49}, "series": [], "links": null}

Introducing a cast of familiar and not-so-familiar characters, historian of science George B. Dyson traces the course of the information revolution, illuminating the lives and work of visionaries--from Thomas Hobbes to John von Neumann--who foresaw the development of artificial intelligence, artificial life, and artificial mind.  This profound and elegant book derives both its title and its outlook from Samuel Butler's 1863 essay, \"Darwin Among the Machines.\" Observing the beginnings of miniaturization, self-reproduction, and telecommunication among machines, Butler predicted that nature's intelligence, only temporarily subservient to technology, would resurface to claim our creations as her own. Updating Butler's arguments, Dyson distills the historical record to chronicle the origins of digital telecommunications and the evolution of digital computers, beginning long before the time of Darwin and exploring the limits of Darwinian evolution to suggest what lies beyond. Weaving a cohesive narrative of his brilliant predecessors, Dyson constructs a straightforward, convincing, and occasionally frightening view of the evolution of mind in the global network, on a level transcending our own. Dyson concludes that we are in the midst of an experiment that echoes the prehistory of human intelligence and the origins of life.  Just as the exchange of coded molecular instructions brought life as we know it to the early earth's primordial soup, and as language and mind combined to form the culture in which we live, so, in the digital universe, are computer programs and worldwide networks combining to produce an evolutionary theater in which the distinctions between nature and technology are increasingly obscured.

This book was written extending and complementing preexisting educational videos on database technology I designed and recorded in winter 2013/14. The main goal of these videos was to use them in my flipped classroom \u201cDatabase Systems\u201d which is an intermediate-level university course designed for B.Sc. students in their third year or M.Sc. students of computer science and related disciplines. Though in general my students liked both the flipped classroom model and (most of) the videos, several students asked for an additional written script that would allow them to quickly lookup explanations for material in text that would otherwise be hard to re-find in the videos. Therefore, in spring 2015, I started working on such a course script which more and more evolved into something that I feel comfortable calling it a book. One central question I had to confront was: would I repeat all material from the videos in the textbook? In other words, would the book be designed to work without the videos? I quickly realized that writing such an old-fashioned text-oriented book, a \u201ctextbook\u201d, wouldn\u2019t be the appropriate thing to do anymore in 2015. My videos as well as the accompanying material are freely available to everyone anyways. And unless you are sitting on the local train from Saarbr\u00fccken to Neustadt, you will almost always have Internet access to watch them. In fact, downloading the videos in advance isn\u2019t terribly hard anyway. This observation changed the original purpose of what this book would be good for: not so much the primary source of the course\u2019s content, but a different view on that content, explaining that content where possible in other words. In addition, one goal was to be concise in the textual explanations allowing you to quickly re-find and remember things you learned from the videos without going through a large body of text.Therefore you will find several things in this book, including: (1) links to videos as well as slides I designed for this course, (2) for each video a textual summary of the video content phrased as questions and answers plus the most important slides and graphics from the videos, (3) Q&As as well as (4) exercises.", "genres": [], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29098122-patterns-in-data-management", "pages_n": 419, "pub_time": "2016-02-02T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": null, "book_publisher": "Jens Dittrich", "book_isbn": null, "book_isbn13": null, "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "14986575", "name": "Jens Dittrich", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4, "rating_count": 1, "rating_count_dist": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "reviews_count": 0}, "series": [], "links": null}

Modern reading is a silent and solitary activity. Ancient reading was usually oral, either aloud, in groups, or individually, in a muffled voice. The text format in which thought has been presented to readers has undergone many changes in order to reach the form that the modern Western reader now views as immutable and nearly universal. This book explains how a change in writing\u2014the introduction of word separation\u2014led to the development of silent reading during the period from late antiquity to the fifteenth century.Over the course of the nine centuries following Rome\u2019s fall, the task of separating the words in continuous written text, which for half a millennium had been a function of the individual reader\u2019s mind and voice, became instead a labor of professional readers and scribes. The separation of words (and thus silent reading) originated in manuscripts copied by Irish scribes in the seventh and eighth centuries but spread to the European continent only in the late tenth century when scholars first attempted to master a newly recovered corpus of technical, philosophical, and scientific classical texts.Why was word separation so long in coming? The author finds the answer in ancient reading habits with their oral basis, and in the social context where reading and writing took place. The ancient world had no desire to make reading easier and swifter. For various reasons, what modern readers view as advantages\u2014retrieval of reference information, increased ability to read \u201cdifficult\u201d texts, greater diffusion of literacy\u2014were not seen as advantages in the ancient world. The notion that a larger portion of the population should be autonomous and self-motivated readers was entirely foreign to the ancient world\u2019s elitist mentality.The greater part of this book describes in detail how the new format of word separation, in conjunction with silent reading, spread from the British Isles and took gradual hold in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. The book concludes with the triumph of silent reading in the scholasticism and devotional practices of the late Middle Ages.", "genres": [{"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Books About Books", "slug": "books-about-books"}, {"name": "Historical", "slug": "historical"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225521.Space_Between_Words", "pages_n": 504, "pub_time": "2000-01-01T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1997-12-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Stanford University Press", "book_isbn": "080474016X", "book_isbn13": "9780804740166", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "132005", "name": "Paul Saenger", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 3.81, "rating_count": 27, "rating_count_dist": [0, 2, 7, 12, 6], "reviews_count": 3}, "series": [], "links": null}

Commercial game development expert Robert Nystrom presents an array of general solutions to problems encountered in game development. For example, you'll learn how double-buffering enables a player to perceive smooth and realistic motion, and how the service locator pattern can help you provide access to services such as sound without coupling your code to any particular sound driver or sound hardware.  Games have much in common with other software, but also a number of unique constraints. Some of the patterns in this book are well-known in other domains of software development. Other of the patterns are unique to gaming. In either case, Robert Nystrom bridges from the ivory tower world of software architecture to the in-the-trenches reality of hardcore game programming. You'll learn the patterns and the general problems that they solve. You'll come away able to apply powerful and reusable architectural solutions that enable you to produce higher quality games with less effort than before.  Applies classic design patterns to game programming. Introduces new patterns specific to game programming. Brings abstract software architecture down to Earth with approachable writing and an emphasis on simple code that shows each pattern in practice. What you'll learn Overcome architectural challenges unique to game programming Apply lessons from the larger software world to games. Tie different parts of a game (graphics, sound, AI) into a cohesive whole. Create elegant and maintainable architecture. Achieve good, low-level performance. Gain insight into professional, game development. Who this book is for\r\n\r\nGame Programming Patterns is aimed at professional game programmers who, while successful in shipping games, are frustrated at how hard it sometimes is to add and modify features when a game is under development. Game Programming Patterns shows how to apply modern software practices to the problem of game development while still maintaining the blazing-fast performance demanded by hard-core gamers.  Game Programming Patterns also appeals to those learning about game programming in their spare time. Hobbyists and aspiring professionals alike will find much to learn in this book about pathfinding, collision detection, and other game-programming problem domains.", "genres": [{"name": "Programming", "slug": "programming"}, {"name": "Game Design", "slug": "game-design"}, {"name": "Computer Science", "slug": "computer-science"}, {"name": "Technology", "slug": "technology"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Games", "slug": "games"}, {"name": "Software", "slug": "software"}, {"name": "Technical", "slug": "technical"}, {"name": "Coding", "slug": "coding"}, {"name": "Gaming", "slug": "gaming"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15499449-game-programming-patterns", "pages_n": 300, "pub_time": "2011-01-01T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2011-01-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Genever Benning", "book_isbn": "1430231505", "book_isbn13": "9781430231509", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "6332712", "name": "Robert Nystrom", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.5, "rating_count": 1221, "rating_count_dist": [3, 13, 89, 384, 732], "reviews_count": 94}, "series": [], "links": null}

Costs are increasing along with the number of developers. Power bills for distributed projects have reached the point where optimisations pay literal dividends.

This unique volume comprises the lectures that Ricoeur gave on Plato and Aristotle at the University of Strasbourg in 1953-54.   The aim of these lectures is to analyse the metaphysics of Plato and Aristotle and to discern in their work the ontological foundations of Western philosophy. The relation between Plato and Aristotle is commonly portrayed as a contrast between a philosophy of essence and a philosophy of substance, but Ricoeur shows that this opposition is too simple. Aristotelian ontology is not a simple antithesis to Platonism: the radical ontology of Aristotle stands in a far more subtle relation of continuity and opposition to that of Plato and it is this relation we have to reconstruct and understand.  Ricoeur's lectures offer a brilliant analysis of the great works of Plato and Aristotle which has withstood the test of time. They also provide a unique insight into the development of Ricoeur's thinking in the early 1950s, revealing that, even at this early stage of his work, Ricoeur was focused sharply on issues of language and the text.", "genres": [{"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18118769-being-essence-and-substance-in-plato-and-aristotle", "pages_n": 260, "pub_time": "2013-09-03T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1982-01-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Polity Press", "book_isbn": "0745660541", "book_isbn13": "9780745660547", "book_language": null, "primary_contributor": {"id": "72421", "name": "Paul Ric\u0153ur", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.2, "rating_count": 10, "rating_count_dist": [1, 0, 1, 2, 6], "reviews_count": 1}, "series": [], "links": null}

The creative and technical logistics that go into building today's hottest games can be more harrowing and complex than the games themselves, often seeming like an endless maze or a bottomless abyss. In Blood, Sweat, and Pixels, Jason Schreier takes readers on a fascinating odyssey behind the scenes of video game development, where the creator may be a team of 600 overworked underdogs or a solitary geek genius. Exploring the artistic challenges, technical impossibilities, marketplace demands, and Donkey Kong-sized monkey wrenches thrown into the works by corporate, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels reveals how bringing any game to completion is more than Sisyphean\u2014it's nothing short of miraculous.Taking some of the most popular, bestselling recent games, Schreier immerses readers in the hellfire of the development process, whether it's RPG studio Bioware's challenge to beat an impossible schedule and overcome countless technical nightmares to build Dragon Age: Inquisition; indie developer Eric Barone's single-handed efforts to grow country-life RPG Stardew Valley from one man's vision into a multi-million-dollar franchise; or Bungie spinning out from their corporate overlords at Microsoft to create Destiny, a brand new universe that they hoped would become as iconic as Star Wars and Lord of the Rings\u2014even as it nearly ripped their studio apart. Documenting the round-the-clock crunches, buggy-eyed burnout, and last-minute saves, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels is a journey through development hell\u2014and ultimately a tribute to the dedicated diehards and unsung heroes who scale mountains of obstacles in their quests to create the best games imaginable.", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Video Games", "slug": "video-games"}, {"name": "Business", "slug": "business"}, {"name": "Gaming", "slug": "gaming"}, {"name": "Games", "slug": "games"}, {"name": "Technology", "slug": "technology"}, {"name": "Audiobook", "slug": "audiobook"}, {"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Game Design", "slug": "game-design"}, {"name": "Programming", "slug": "programming"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34376766-blood-sweat-and-pixels", "pages_n": 304, "pub_time": "2017-09-05T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2017-10-04T07:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Harper Paperbacks", "book_isbn": null, "book_isbn13": null, "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "16222011", "name": "Jason Schreier", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.21, "rating_count": 16398, "rating_count_dist": [58, 346, 2211, 7197, 6586], "reviews_count": 1648}, "series": [], "links": null}

If a Prince is not given to vices that make him hated, it is unsusal for his subjects to show their affection for him. 3.

Without faith and religion, man achieves power but not glory. 5. Prominent citizens want to command and oppress; the populace only wants to be free of oppression. 6. A Prince needs a friendly populace; otherwise in diversity there is no hope. 7. A Prince, who rules as a man of valor, avoids disasters, 8.

It views the human animal as a unique being, endowed with an instinctual capacity. It asks and answers an intriguing question: why are animals in the wild, though threatened routinely, rarely traumatized? By understanding the dynamics that make wild animals virtually immune to traumatic symptoms, the mystery of human trauma is revealed.\r\n\r\nWaking the Tiger normalizes the symptoms of trauma and the steps needed to heal them. People are often traumatized by seemingly ordinary experiences. The reader is taken on a guided tour of the subtle, yet powerful impulses that govern our responses to overwhelming life events. To do this, it employs a series of exercises that help us focus on bodily sensations. Through heightened awareness of these sensations trauma can be healed.", "genres": [{"name": "Psychology", "slug": "psychology"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Self Help", "slug": "self-help"}, {"name": "Mental Health", "slug": "mental-health"}, {"name": "Health", "slug": "health"}, {"name": "Counselling", "slug": "counselling"}, {"name": "Social Work", "slug": "social-work"}, {"name": "Personal Development", "slug": "personal-development"}, {"name": "Spirituality", "slug": "spirituality"}, {"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/384924.Waking_the_Tiger", "pages_n": 288, "pub_time": "1997-07-07T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1997-01-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "North Atlantic Books", "book_isbn": "155643233X", "book_isbn13": "9781556432330", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "142956", "name": "Peter A.

Named the best series of all time by the Hugo Awards, the Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov unquestionably comprise one of the great masterworks of science fiction, unsurpassed for its unique blend of nonstop action, daring ideas, and extensive world-building. Now, all seven volumes are together for the first time in this essential eBook bundle:   FOUNDATION FOUNDATION AND EMPIRE SECOND FOUNDATION FOUNDATION\u2019S EDGE FOUNDATION AND EARTH PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION FORWARD THE FOUNDATION   For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. Only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future\u2014a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save humanity, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire\u2014both scientists and scholars\u2014and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls this sanctuary the Foundation.   But soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the wake of the receding Empire. And mankind\u2019s last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: submit to the barbarians and live as slaves\u2014or take a stand for freedom and risk total destruction.   Praise for Isaac Asimov and his Foundation series   \u201cA true polymath, a superb rationalist, an exciting and accessible writer in both fiction and nonfiction, Isaac Asimov was simply a master of all he surveyed.\u201d\u2014Greg Bear   \u201cAsimov served wondrous meals-of-the-mind to a civilization that was starved for clear thinking about the future. To this day, his visions spice our ongoing dinner-table conversation about human destiny.\u201d\u2014David Brin   \u201cIsaac was still in his teens when I met him, a fan of mine before I was a fan of his. Writing for John W. Campbell back in the famous \u2018golden age of science fiction,\u2019 he became one of the founders of our field. With the Robot stories and the Foundation stories, he helped to shape science fiction as we know it.\u201d\u2014Jack Williamson   \u201cI grew up on the ABC\u2019s of science fiction\u2014Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke. There\u2019s a reason Asimov\u2019s name comes first, and not just because of the alphabet!\u201d\u2014Janis Ian   \u201cWith his fertile imagination, his wit, and his prolific output, Isaac Asimov truly laid the foundation for all future generations of science fiction writers.\u201d\u2014Kevin J. Anderson   \u201cIf anything can be said to have been the launch pad for space-age science fiction, it has to be the Foundation trilogy. It\u2019s a classic. And it\u2019s unforgettable.\u201d\u2014Jack McDevitt   \u201cThe Foundation series is one of the masterpieces of science fiction. If you\u2019ve never read these novels, then you\u2019re in for a treat, and even if you\u2019ve already read them, then you owe it to yourself to reread them, because they\u2019re still great.\u201d\u2014Allen Steele   \u201cQuite simply, Asimov got me started.\u201d\u2014Liz Williams", "genres": [{"name": "Science Fiction", "slug": "science-fiction"}, {"name": "Fiction", "slug": "fiction"}, {"name": "Collections", "slug": "collections"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23005036-the-foundation-novels-7-book-bundle", "pages_n": null, "pub_time": "2014-08-05T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": null, "book_publisher": "Spectra", "book_isbn": null, "book_isbn13": null, "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "16667", "name": "Isaac Asimov", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.58, "rating_count": 383, "rating_count_dist": [2, 1, 34, 83, 263], "reviews_count": 17}, "series": [{"title": "Foundation (Publication Order)", "id": "59386", "position": "1-7"}], "links": null}

As newly appointed captain of the USS Santa Fe, a nuclear-powered submarine, he was responsible for more than a hundred sailors, deep in the sea. In this high-stress environment, where there is no margin for error, it was crucial his men did their job and did it well.But the ship was dogged by poor morale, poor performance, and the worst retention in the fleet. Marquet acted like any other captain until, one day, he unknowingly gave an impossible order, and his crew tried to follow it anyway. When he asked why the order wasn't challenged, the answer was \"Because you told me to.\" Marquet realized he was leading in a culture of followers, and they were all in danger unless they fundamentally changed the way they did things. That's when Marquet took matters into his own hands and pushed for leadership at every level. Turn the Ship Around! is the true story of how the Santa Fe skyrocketed from worst to first in the fleet by challenging the U.S. Navy's traditional leader-follower approach. Struggling against his own instincts to take control, he instead achieved the vastly more powerful model of giving control. Before long, each member of Marquet's crew became a leader and assumed responsibility for everything he did, from clerical tasks to crucial combat decisions. The crew became fully engaged, contributing their full intellectual capacity every day, and the Santa Fe started winning awards and promoting a highly disproportionate number of officers to submarine command.No matter your business or position, you can apply Marquet's radical guidelines to turn your own ship around. The payoff: a workplace where everyone around you is taking responsibility for their actions, where people are healthier and happier, where everyone is a leader.", "genres": [{"name": "Leadership", "slug": "leadership"}, {"name": "Business", "slug": "business"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Management", "slug": "management"}, {"name": "Military Fiction", "slug": "military-fiction"}, {"name": "Self Help", "slug": "self-help"}, {"name": "Personal Development", "slug": "personal-development"}, {"name": "Buisness", "slug": "buisness"}, {"name": "Audiobook", "slug": "audiobook"}, {"name": "Psychology", "slug": "psychology"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158601-turn-the-ship-around", "pages_n": 272, "pub_time": "2013-05-16T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2013-05-16T07:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Portfolio", "book_isbn": "1591846404", "book_isbn13": "9781591846406", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "5813472", "name": "L.

An impassioned critique of K 12 mathematics education, it outlined how we shortchange students by introducing them to math the wrong way. Here Lockhart offers the positive side of the math education story by showing us how math should be done. \"Measurement \"offers a permanent solution to math phobia by introducing us to mathematics as an artful way of thinking and living.\n\nIn conversational prose that conveys his passion for the subject, Lockhart makes mathematics accessible without oversimplifying. He makes no more attempt to hide the challenge of mathematics than he does to shield us from its beautiful intensity. Favoring plain English and pictures over jargon and formulas, he succeeds in making complex ideas about the mathematics of shape and motion intuitive and graspable. His elegant discussion of mathematical reasoning and themes in classical geometry offers proof of his conviction that mathematics illuminates art as much as science.\n\nLockhart leads us into a universe where beautiful designs and patterns float through our minds and do surprising, miraculous things. As we turn our thoughts to symmetry, circles, cylinders, and cones, we begin to see that almost anyone can do the math in a way that brings emotional and aesthetic rewards. \"Measurement\" is an invitation to summon curiosity, courage, and creativity in order to experience firsthand the playful excitement of mathematical work.\"", "genres": [{"name": "Mathematics", "slug": "mathematics"}, {"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Teaching", "slug": "teaching"}, {"name": "Education", "slug": "education"}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}, {"name": "Physics", "slug": "physics"}, {"name": "Economics", "slug": "economics"}, {"name": "Self Help", "slug": "self-help"}, {"name": "Audiobook", "slug": "audiobook"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15701297-measurement", "pages_n": 416, "pub_time": "2012-09-01T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2012-08-20T07:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Belknap Press", "book_isbn": "0674057554", "book_isbn13": "9780674057555", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "6421135", "name": "Paul  Lockhart", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.27, "rating_count": 477, "rating_count_dist": [7, 17, 62, 146, 245], "reviews_count": 58}, "series": [], "links": null}

It argues that, unlike the \"subject\" (who comes into existence as a result of symbolic prohibition) or the \"person\" (who is aligned with the narcissistic conceits of the imaginary), the singular self emerges in response to a galvanizing directive arising from the real. This directive carries the force of an obligation that cannot be resisted and that summons the individual to a \"character\" beyond his or her social investments. Consequently, singularity expresses something about the individual's non-negotiable distinctiveness, eccentricity, or idiosyncrasy at the same time it prevents both symbolic and imaginary closure. It opens to layers of rebelliousness, indicating that there are components of human life exceeding the realm of normative sociality.\n\n\n\nWritten with an unusual blend of rigor and clarity,  The Singularity of Being combines incisive readings of Lacan with the best insights of recent Lacanian theory to reach beyond the dogmas of the field. Moving from what, thanks in part to Slavoj Zizek, has come to be known as the \"ethics of the act\" to a nuanced interpretation of Lacan's \"ethics of sublimation,\" the book offers a sweeping overview of Lacan's thought while making an original contribution to contemporary theory and ethics. Aimed at specialists and nonspecialists alike, the book manages to educate at the same time as it intervenes in current debates about subjectivity, agency, resistance, creativity, the self-other relationship, and effective political and ethical action. By focusing on the Lacanian real, Ruti honors the uniqueness of subjective experience without losing sight of the social and intersubjective components of human life.", "genres": [{"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}, {"name": "Psychoanalysis", "slug": "psychoanalysis"}, {"name": "Psychology", "slug": "psychology"}, {"name": "Theory", "slug": "theory"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13796970-the-singularity-of-being", "pages_n": 272, "pub_time": "2012-09-03T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2012-06-01T07:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Fordham University Press", "book_isbn": "082324315X", "book_isbn13": "9780823243150", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "366346", "name": "Mari Ruti", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.23, "rating_count": 97, "rating_count_dist": [3, 3, 11, 32, 48], "reviews_count": 15}, "series": [], "links": null}

How do we reconcile these two standpoints--intellectually, morally, and practically? To what extent are they irreconcilable and to what extent can they be integrated? Thomas Nagel's ambitious and lively book tackles this fundamental issue, arguing that our divided nature is the root of a whole range of philosophical problems, touching, as it does, every aspect of human life. He deals with its manifestations in such fields of philosophy as: the mind-body problem, personal identity, knowledge and skepticism, thought and reality, free will, ethics, the relation between moral and other values, the meaning of life, and death. Excessive objectification has been a malady of recent analytic philosophy, claims Nagel, it has led to implausible forms of reductionism in the philosophy of mind and elsewhere. The solution is not to inhibit the objectifying impulse, but to insist that it learn to live alongside the internal perspectives that cannot be either discarded or objectified.

Aries traces the evolution of the concept of childhood from the end of the Middle Ages, when the child was regarded as a small adult, to the present child-centered society, by means of diaries, paintings, games, and school curricula.\n\nIronically, he finds that individualism, far from triumphing in our time, has been held in check by the family, and that the increasing power of the tightly-knit family circle has flourished at the expense of the rich-textured communal society of earlier times.

Recognizing why we do the things we do. Understanding the impact of our actions. Creating value - not just product. For ourselves, our families, our friends, our co-workers. For our legacy.Personal Kanban takes the same Lean principles from manufacturing that led the Japanese auto industry to become a global leader in quality, and applies them to individual and team work. Personal Kanban asks only that we visualize our work and limit our work-in-progress. Visualizing work allows us to transform our conceptual and threatening workload into an actionable, context-sensitive flow. Limiting our work-in-progress helps us complete what we start and understand the value of our choices. Combined, these two simple acts encourage us to improve the way we work and the way we make choices to balance our personal, professional, and social lives.Neither a prescription nor a plan, Personal Kanban provides a light, actionable, achievable framework for understanding our work and its context.

It deals with all dimensions of a system: structure, function and process. Peter Senge introduced Systems Thinking/practice. Interact clients asked the author to write a book to take them \"further down the Senge trail\". This book does that by taking the reader into \"real world\" stories. It is based on experiences in five real companies using systems practice.\r\nIt is about a new mode of seeing, doing and being in the world; a way of thinking through chaos and complexity. It speaks to those thinkers and practitioners who have come to realize that learning \"to be\" is as much a necessary part of a successful professional life as is the learning \"to do.\"\r\nNatural science has discovered \"chaos\". Social science has encountered \"complexity.\" But chaos and complexity are features of our perceptions and understanding. We see the world as increasingly more complex and chaotic because we use inadequate concepts to explain it. When we understand something, we no longer see it as chaotic or complex. It seems that playing the new game requires learning a new language. A language of interaction and design that will allow us to see through chaos and understand complexity.\r\nIn a nutshell, this book is about systems. However, it goes beyond the simple declaration of desirability of systems thinking. With a practical orientation and yet a profound theoretical depth, the book offers an operational handle on the whole by introducing an elaborate scheme called iterative design. The iterative design explicitly recognizes that choice is at the heart of human development. Development is the capacity to choose; design is a vehicle for enhancement of choice and holistic thinking. Designers, in this book, seek to choose rather than predict the future. They try to understand rational, emotional, and cultural dimensions of choice and to produce a design that satisfies a multitude of functions.

In this new edition, Margaret Wheatley describes how the new science radically alters our understanding of the world and how it can teach us to live and work well together in these chaotic times.   We live in a time of chaos, rich in potential for new possibilities. A new world is being born. We need new ideas, new ways of seeing, and new relationships to help us now. New science--the new discoveries in biology, chaos theory, and quantum physics that are changing our understanding of how the world works--offers this guidance. It describes a world where chaos is natural, where order exists for free. It displays the intricate webs of cooperation that connect us. It assures us that life seeks order, but uses messes to get there.\n\nThis book will teach you how to move with greater certainty and easier grace into the new forms of organizations and communities that are taking shape. You'll learn that:\n\n- Relationships are what matters--even at the subatomic level - Life is a vast web of interconnections where cooperation and participation are required - Chaos and change are the only route to transformation\n\nIn this expanded edition, Wheatley provides examples of how non-linear networks and self-organizing systems are flourishing in the modern world.

Lessons from the CEO of INTEL Corporation", "title_original": "Only the Paranoid Survive", "description": "The President and CEO of Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, reveals how to identify and exploit the key moments of change in any industry that generates either drastic failure or incredible success. Under Andrew Grove's leadership, Intel has become the world's largest computer chipmaker, the 5th most admired company in America, and the 7th most profitable company among the Fortune 500. Few CEOs can claim this level of success. Grove attributes much of it to the philosophy and strategy he has learned the hard way as he steered Intel through a series of potential major disasters. There are moments in any business when massive change occurs, when all the rules of business shift fast, furiously and forever. Grove calls such moments strategic inflection points (SIPs), and he has lived through several. They can be set off by almost anything - by mega competition, an arcane change in regulations, or by a seemingly modest change in technology. They are not always easy to spot - but you can't hide from them. Intel's first SIP was when the Japanese started producing better-quality, lower-cost memory chips. It took Grove three years and huge losses to recognize that he had to rethink and reposition the company to become, once again, leader in its field.Grove extrapolates the lessons he has learned from this and other SIPs - for instance the drama of the Pentium flaw, and the SIP brought on by the Internet - to reveal a unique insight into the management of change. He recounts strategies from other companies and examines his own record of success and failure. Only the Paranoid Survive is a classic lesson in leadership skills that every manager in every industry will benefit from. Every manager must assume that something will change - very soon.", "genres": [{"name": "Business", "slug": "business"}, {"name": "Management", "slug": "management"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Leadership", "slug": "leadership"}, {"name": "Biography", "slug": "biography"}, {"name": "Technology", "slug": "technology"}, {"name": "Entrepreneurship", "slug": "entrepreneurship"}, {"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Buisness", "slug": "buisness"}, {"name": "Finance", "slug": "finance"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66863.Only_the_Paranoid_Survive_Lessons_from_the_CEO_of_INTEL_Corporation", "pages_n": 224, "pub_time": "1998-04-06T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1988-04-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Profile Business", "book_isbn": "1861975139", "book_isbn13": "9781861975133", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "37708", "name": "Andrew S.

Are there gateways to parallel universes? What happened before the first day of Creation? These types of questions are at the center of current scientific activity. Indeed, many physicists today believe that there are other dimensions beyond the four of our space-time, and that a unified vision of the various forces of nature can be achieved, if we consider that everything we see around us, from the trees to the stars are nothing but vibrations in hyperspace. Hyperspace theory - and its more recent derivation, superstring theory - is the eye of this revolution. In this book, Michio Kaku shows us a fascinating panorama, which completely changes our view of the cosmos, and takes us on a dazzling journey through new dimensions: wormholes connecting parallel universes, time machines, \"baby universes\" and more.

So why one more? Most books focus on just a subset of what is required to delivery end-to-end solutions in an agile manner. Developing a coherent approach to the complete picture by piecing together these practices is difficult, especially when the advice in many of these books is conflicting and not well researched, often based on just a few successful applications in a specific context. Disciplined Agile Delivery is the only toolkit available that combines the most effective practices across lean and agile methods into one comprehensive, agnostic, and context-driven approach that you can use to optimize your way of working (WoW). This handbook is an indispensable guide for agile coaches and practitioners for understanding what options are effective in certain situations and not as effective in others. This advice is based on proven experience from hundreds of organizations facing similar situations to yours. There are many ways that a team can adopt to help them improve their WoW, strategies that are captured in this book. Many people recommend an experimental approach to improvement, and we\u2019ve found guided experiments to be even more effective. The basic idea with the PDSA/PDCA/OODA continuous improvement loop strategy is that you improve your WoW as a series of small changes, a strategy the lean community calls kaizen, which is Japanese for improvement. The first step is to identify a potential improvement, such as a new practice or strategy, that you want to experiment with to see how well it works for you in the context of your situation. The value of DA is that it can guide you through this identification step by helping you to identify a new practice/strategy that is likely to address the challenge you\u2019re hoping to address. By doing so you increase your chance of identifying a potential improvement that works for you, thereby speeding up your efforts to improve your WoW \u2013 we call this guided continuous improvement. There are several ways that this book provides the guidance your team requires to choose and evolve your WoW. First, it describes size lifecycles to choose from, providing lightweight guidance for when and when not to choose each one. These lifecycles are: A Scrum-based Agile project lifecycle, a Kanban-based Lean project lifecycle, an Agile Continuous Delivery lifecycle, a Lean Continuous Delivery lifecycle, a Program (team of teams) lifecycle, and a Lean Startup-based Exploratory lifecycle.

What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their version of such issues for decades.

However, most discussions of Bayesian inference rely on intensely complex mathematical analyses and artificial examples, making it inaccessible to anyone without a strong mathematical background. Now, though, Cameron Davidson-Pilon introduces Bayesian inference from a computational perspective, bridging theory to practice-freeing you to get results using computing power. Bayesian Methods for Hackers illuminates Bayesian inference through probabilistic programming with the powerful PyMC language and the closely related Python tools NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Using this approach, you can reach effective solutions in small increments, without extensive mathematical intervention. Davidson-Pilon begins by introducing the concepts underlying Bayesian inference, comparing it with other techniques and guiding you through building and training your first Bayesian model. Next, he introduces PyMC through a series of detailed examples and intuitive explanations that have been refined after extensive user feedback. You'll learn how to use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, choose appropriate sample sizes and priors, work with loss functions, and apply Bayesian inference in domains ranging from finance to marketing. Once you've mastered these techniques, you'll constantly turn to this guide for the working PyMC code you need to jumpstart future projects. Coverage includes   - Learning the Bayesian \"state of mind\" and its practical implications - Understanding how computers perform Bayesian inference - Using the PyMC Python library to program Bayesian analyses - Building and debugging models with PyMC - Testing your model's \"goodness of fit\" - Opening the \"black box\" of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to see how and why it works - Leveraging the power of the \"Law of Large Numbers\" - Mastering key concepts, such as clustering, convergence, autocorrelation, and thinning - Using loss functions to measure an estimate's weaknesses based on your goals and desired outcomes - Selecting appropriate priors and understanding how their influence changes with dataset size - Overcoming the \"exploration versus exploitation\" dilemma: deciding when \"pretty good\" is good enough - Using Bayesian inference to improve A/B testing - Solving data science problems when only small amounts of data are available Cameron Davidson-Pilon has worked in many areas of applied mathematics, from the evolutionary dynamics of genes and diseases to stochastic modeling of financial prices. His contributions to the open source community include lifelines, an implementation of survival analysis in Python.

{"book_id": "166195", "title": "Modern Operating Systems", "title_full": "Modern Operating Systems", "title_original": "Modern Operating Systems", "description": "For software development professionals and computer science students, Modern Operating Systems gives a solid conceptual overview of operating system design, including detailed case studies of Unix/Linux and Windows 2000.     What makes an operating system modern? According to author Andrew Tanenbaum, it is the awareness of high-demand computer applications--primarily in the areas of multimedia, parallel and distributed computing, and security. The development of faster and more advanced hardware has driven progress in software, including enhancements to the operating system. It is one thing to run an old operating system on current hardware, and another to effectively leverage current hardware to best serve modern software applications. If you don't believe it, install Windows 3.0 on a modern PC and try surfing the Internet or burning a CD.     Readers familiar with Tanenbaum's previous text, Operating Systems, know the author is a great proponent of simple design and hands-on experimentation. His earlier book came bundled with the source code for an operating system called Minux, a simple variant of Unix and the platform used by Linus Torvalds to develop Linux. Although this book does not come with any source code, he illustrates many of his points with code fragments (C, usually with Unix system calls).     The first half of Modern Operating Systems focuses on traditional operating systems concepts: processes, deadlocks, memory management, I/O, and file systems. There is nothing groundbreaking in these early chapters, but all topics are well covered, each including sections on current research and a set of student problems. It is enlightening to read Tanenbaum's explanations of the design decisions made by past operating systems gurus, including his view that additional research on the problem of deadlocks is impractical except for \"keeping otherwise unemployed graph theorists off the streets.\"    It is the second half of the book that differentiates itself from older operating systems texts. Here, each chapter describes an element of what constitutes a modern operating system--awareness of multimedia applications, multiple processors, computer networks, and a high level of security. The chapter on multimedia functionality focuses on such features as handling massive files and providing video-on-demand. Included in the discussion on multiprocessor platforms are clustered computers and distributed computing. Finally, the importance of security is discussed--a lively enumeration of the scores of ways operating systems can be vulnerable to attack, from password security to computer viruses and Internet worms.     Included at the end of the book are case studies of two popular operating systems: Unix/Linux and Windows 2000. There is a bias toward the Unix/Linux approach, not surprising given the author's experience and academic bent, but this bias does not detract from Tanenbaum's analysis. Both operating systems are dissected, describing how each implements processes, file systems, memory management, and other operating system fundamentals.      Tanenbaum's mantra is simple, accessible operating system design. Given that modern operating systems have extensive features, he is forced to reconcile physical size with simplicity. Toward this end, he makes frequent references to the Frederick Brooks classic The Mythical Man-Month for wisdom on managing large, complex software development projects. He finds both Windows 2000 and Unix/Linux guilty of being too complicated--with a particular skewering of Windows 2000 and its \"mammoth Win32 API.\" A primary culprit is the attempt to make operating systems more \"user-friendly,\" which Tanenbaum views as an excuse for bloated code.

Martin Series)", "description": "Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn't have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with  Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code on the fly into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You'll be reading code - lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what's right about that code, and what's wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.  Clean Code  is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code - of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and \"smells\" gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.

Taken literally, it implies that there are many universes \u201cparallel\u201d to the one we see around us. This multiplicity of universes, according to Deutsch, turns out to be the key to achieving a new worldview, one which synthesizes the theories of evolution, computation, and knowledge with quantum physics. Considered jointly, these four strands of explanation reveal a unified fabric of reality that is both objective and comprehensible, the subject of this daring, challenging book. The Fabric of Reality explains and connects many topics at the leading edge of current research and thinking, such as quantum computers (which work by effectively collaborating with their counterparts in other universes), the physics of time travel, the comprehensibility of nature and the physical limits of virtual reality, the significance of human life, and the ultimate fate of the universe.

Cheese consumption, margarine and drowning by falling out of fishing boats. This book has got it all. A roller coaster of a book in 8 witty chapters, this might just be the most entertaining statistics book you\u2019ll read this year.  Did you know that pirates caused global warming, and that a statistical lie gave rise to one of the fastest growing religions on the planet? Probably not \u2013 you might have missed the memo that day. Did you also know that organic food is the real cause of autism, and that Mexican lemons are a major cause of deaths on American roads? They\u2019re true, honest \u2013 and this book has got the stats to prove it. In this eye-opening book, award winning statistician and author Lee Baker uncovers the key tricks of the trade used by politicians, corporations and other statistical conmen to deceive, hoodwink and otherwise dupe the unwary. Like how the ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer attempted to persuade us that 5 lots of 10 make 150, or how the President of the United States tried to convince us that 420,000 is a larger number than 782,000. Nice try boys, but we were awake that day! In his trademark sardonic style, the author reveals the secrets of how the statistical hustlers manipulate and misrepresent data for political or commercial gain \u2013 and often get away with it.

Kaag sets off for the Swiss peaks above Sils Maria where Nietzsche wrote his landmark work Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Both of Kaag's journeys are made in search of the wisdom at the core of Nietzsche's philosophy, yet they deliver him to radically different interpretations and, more crucially, revelations about the human condition.\r\n\r\nJust as Kaag's acclaimed debut, American Philosophy: A Love Story, seamlessly wove together his philosophical discoveries with his search for meaning,  Hiking with Nietzsche is a fascinating exploration not only of Nietzsche's ideals but of how his experience of living relates to us as individuals in the twenty-first century. Bold, intimate, and rich with insight, Hiking with Nietzsche is about defeating complacency, balancing sanity and madness, and coming to grips with the unobtainable. As Kaag hikes, alone or with his family, but always with Nietzsche, he recognizes that even slipping can be instructive. It is in the process of climbing, and through the inevitable missteps, that one has the chance, in Nietzsche's words, to \"become who you are.\"", "genres": [{"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Memoir", "slug": "memoir"}, {"name": "Biography", "slug": "biography"}, {"name": "Travel", "slug": "travel"}, {"name": "Walking", "slug": "walking"}, {"name": "Self Help", "slug": "self-help"}, {"name": "Biography Memoir", "slug": "biography-memoir"}, {"name": "Nature", "slug": "nature"}, {"name": "Autobiography", "slug": "autobiography"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37941732-hiking-with-nietzsche", "pages_n": 272, "pub_time": "2018-09-25T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2018-09-25T07:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "book_isbn": "0374170010", "book_isbn13": "9780374170011", "book_language": null, "primary_contributor": {"id": "5760493", "name": "John Kaag", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 3.67, "rating_count": 2323, "rating_count_dist": [40, 202, 737, 860, 484], "reviews_count": 292}, "series": [], "links": null}

Rather, The Color of Law incontrovertibly makes clear that it was de jure segregation\u2014the laws and policy decisions passed by local, state, and federal governments\u2014that actually promoted the discriminatory patterns that continue to this day.\r\n\r\nThrough extraordinary revelations and extensive research that Ta-Nehisi Coates has lauded as \"brilliant\" (The Atlantic), Rothstein comes to chronicle nothing less than an untold story that begins in the 1920s, showing how this process of de jure segregation began with explicit racial zoning, as millions of African Americans moved in a great historical migration from the south to the north.\r\n\r\nAs Jane Jacobs established in her classic The Death and Life of Great American Cities, it was the deeply flawed urban planning of the 1950s that created many of the impoverished neighborhoods we know. Now, Rothstein expands our understanding of this history, showing how government policies led to the creation of officially segregated public housing and the demolition of previously integrated neighborhoods. While urban areas rapidly deteriorated, the great American suburbanization of the post\u2013World War II years was spurred on by federal subsidies for builders on the condition that no homes be sold to African Americans. Finally, Rothstein shows how police and prosecutors brutally upheld these standards by supporting violent resistance to black families in white neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nThe Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibited future discrimination but did nothing to reverse residential patterns that had become deeply embedded. Yet recent outbursts of violence in cities like Baltimore, Ferguson, and Minneapolis show us precisely how the legacy of these earlier eras contributes to persistent racial unrest. \u201cThe American landscape will never look the same to readers of this important book\u201d (Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund), as Rothstein\u2019s invaluable examination shows that only by relearning this history can we finally pave the way for the nation to remedy its unconstitutional past.", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Race", "slug": "race"}, {"name": "Politics", "slug": "politics"}, {"name": "Social Justice", "slug": "social-justice"}, {"name": "Anti Racist", "slug": "anti-racist"}, {"name": "Law", "slug": "law"}, {"name": "Sociology", "slug": "sociology"}, {"name": "American History", "slug": "american-history"}, {"name": "Audiobook", "slug": "audiobook"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191706-the-color-of-law", "pages_n": 368, "pub_time": "2017-05-02T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2017-05-02T07:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Liveright", "book_isbn": "1631492853", "book_isbn13": "9781631492853", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "192696", "name": "Richard Rothstein", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.45, "rating_count": 30785, "rating_count_dist": [82, 318, 2332, 10970, 17083], "reviews_count": 4293}, "series": [], "links": null}

The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation\u2014each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.\r\n\r\nEngaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking.

In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. \r\n\r\nThiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we\u2019re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.\r\n\r\nDoing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won\u2019t make a search engine.

In The Phoenix Project, Bill, an IT manager at Parts Unlimited, is tasked with a project critical to the future of the business, code named Phoenix Project. But the project is massively over budget and behind schedule. The CEO demands Bill fix the mess in ninety days or else Bill's entire department will be outsourced. In The Unicorn Project, we follow Maxine, a senior lead developer and architect, as she is exiled to the Phoenix Project, to the horror of her friends and colleagues, as punishment for contributing to a payroll outage. She tries to survive in what feels like a heartless and uncaring bureaucracy and to work within a system where no one can get anything done without endless committees, paperwork, and approvals. One day, she is approached by a ragtag bunch of misfits who say they want to overthrow the existing order, to liberate developers, to bring joy back to technology work, and to enable the business to win in a time of digital disruption. To her surprise, she finds herself drawn ever further into this movement, eventually becoming one of the leaders of the Rebellion, which puts her in the crosshairs of some familiar and very dangerous enemies.

The problem with this version of history? There\u2019s not a shred of evidence to support it.Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that for more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods\u2014that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors.  Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like \u201cguilt,\u201d \u201csin,\u201d and \u201credemption\u201d) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong.

At the same time, the author recounts the dramatic and tragic stories of the handful of Buddhist organizations and individuals that dared to oppose Japan's march to war. He follows this history up through recent apologies by several Zen sects for their support of the war and the way support for militarism was transformed into 'corporate Zen' in postwar Japan.

Davis, from the foreword\n\nHerbert Marcuse was one of the twentieth century's most unlikely pop stars: a celebrity philosopher. In the 1960s, his argument for a \"principled utopianism\" catalyzed the idealism of a rebellious generation, and Marcuse became an intellectual guide for activists and revolutionaries around the world.\n\nFrom his early studies with Martin Heidegger, to his flight from Nazi Germany with Frankfurt School colleagues, to his status as a countercultural icon, readers are introduced to the development of Marcuse's philosophical theories and the political realities that shaped his work.\n\nMarcuse's advocacy for a more humane, sustainable world was grounded in a personal knowledge of authoritarianism's violence, and the risk of its resurgence. Perennially relevant, radical, and inspiring, Marcuse's concept of a \"Great Refusal\"--the protest against that which is--is a guide for our times.\n\nPraise for Herbert Marcuse, Philosopher of Utopia: \n\n\"Nick Thorkelson's exploration of the ideas and personality of Herbert Marcuse is exactly the sort of comic book I have longed to read. It is engaging, artful, and explores the world of revolutionary ideas. Books like this keep the fire going inside.\"--Joe Sacco, author of Footnotes in Gaza\n\n\"A warm, funny, richly detailed biography. Thorkelson has found a powerful graphic style and narrative voice that animate Marcuse's life and his theory of rebellion. As both personal saga and primer on radical political philosophy, it could not be more relevant to today's resistance movement.\"--Dan Wasserman, editorial cartoonist for The Boston Globe\n\n\"Marcuse's energizing sense of critique, hope, politics, and utopian vision are more necessary than ever, especially for the emerging generations of young activists.\"--Henry A. Giroux, author of American Nightmare: Facing the Challenge of Fascism\n\n\"A riotous romp through 20th-century philosophy. The story of a man who exists at the eye of storm of ideas, of movements and of social strategies. With workers and students on the streets of Paris once more, Marcuse's life and work has never been more relevant.\"--Kate Evans, author of Red Rosa: A Graphic Biography\n\n\"Philosopher of Utopia is art on the attack!

In it we find Derrida at work on his systematic deconstruction of Western metaphysics. The book's first half, which includes the celebrated essay on Descartes and Foucault, shows the development of Derrida's method of deconstruction. In these essays, Derrida demonstrates the traditional nature of some purportedly nontraditional currents of modern thought\u2014one of his main targets being the way in which \"structuralism\" unwittingly repeats metaphysical concepts in its use of linguistic models.The second half of the book contains some of Derrida's most compelling analyses of why and how metaphysical thinking must exclude writing from its conception of language, finally showing metaphysics to be constituted by this exclusion.

In his new book, Stillness Is the Key, Holiday draws on timeless Stoic and Buddhist philosophy to show why slowing down is the secret weapon for those charging ahead.\r\n\r\nAll great leaders, thinkers, artists, athletes, and visionaries share one indelible quality. It enables them to conquer their tempers. To avoid distraction and discover great insights. To achieve happiness and do the right thing. Ryan Holiday calls it stillness--to be steady while the world spins around you.\r\n\r\nIn this book, he outlines a path for achieving this ancient, but urgently necessary way of living. Drawing on a wide range of history's greatest thinkers, from Confucius to Seneca, Marcus Aurelius to Thich Nhat Hanh, John Stuart Mill to Nietzsche, he argues that stillness is not mere inactivity, but the doorway to self-mastery, discipline, and focus.\r\n\r\nHoliday also examines figures who exemplified the power of stillness: baseball player Sadaharu Oh, whose study of Zen made him the greatest home run hitter of all time; Winston Churchill, who in balancing his busy public life with time spent laying bricks and painting at his Chartwell estate managed to save the world from annihilation in the process; Fred Rogers, who taught generations of children to see what was invisible to the eye; Anne Frank, whose journaling and love of nature guided her through unimaginable adversity.\r\n\r\nMore than ever, people are overwhelmed. They face obstacles and egos and competition. Stillness Is the Key offers a simple but inspiring antidote to the stress of 24/7 news and social media.

It uses a common data set and utilizes various theoretical perspectives through which to view the data. It challenges qualitative researchers to use theory to accomplish a rigorous, analytic reading of qualitative data. Plugging in the theory and the data produces a variety of readings applying various theorists and their concepts, including:\n\n\n\nDerrida - Deconstruction\n\nSpivak - Postcolonial Marginality\n\nFoucault - Power/Knowledge\n\nButler - Performativity\n\nDeleuze - Desire\n\nBarad - Material Intra-activity Thinking With Theory In Qualitative Research pushes against traditional qualitative data analysis such as mechanistic coding, reducing data to themes, and writing up transparent narratives. These do little to critique the complexities of social life; such simplistic approaches preclude dense and multi-layered treatment of data. It shows that thinking with theory pushes research and data and theory to its exhaustion in order to produce knowledge differently. By refusing a closed system for fixed meaning, a new analytic is engaged to keep meaning on the move. The result is an extension of thought beyond an easy sense.\n\nSpecial features of the book include schematic cues to help guide the reader through what might be new theoretical terrain, interludes that explain the possibilities of thinking with a particular concept and theorist and detailed chapters that plug the same data set into a specific concept. This vital tool will help researchers understand and fully utilize their powers of data analysis and will prove invaluable to both students and experienced researchers across all of the social sciences.", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Research", "slug": "research"}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}, {"name": "Academic", "slug": "academic"}, {"name": "Education", "slug": "education"}, {"name": "Qualitative Research", "slug": "qualitative-research"}, {"name": "Theory", "slug": "theory"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13261709-thinking-with-theory-in-qualitative-research", "pages_n": 152, "pub_time": "2011-12-02T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2011-12-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Routledge", "book_isbn": "0415781000", "book_isbn13": "9780415781008", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "4123900", "name": "Alecia Youngblood Jackson", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [{"id": "1395889", "name": "Lisa A.

It is shaped by the experience of the two teachers teaching statistical methods and concepts to engineering students, over a decade. Practical examples and end-of-chapter exercises are the highlights of the text as they are purposely selected from different fields. Statistical principles discussed in the book have great relevance in several disciplines like economics, commerce, engineering, medicine, health-care, agriculture, biochemistry, and textiles to mention a few. A large number of students with varied disciplinary backgrounds need a course in basics of statistics, the design of experiments and statistical quality control at an introductory level to pursue their discipline of interest. No previous knowledge of probability or statistics is assumed, but an understanding of calculus is a prerequisite. The whole book serves as a master level introductory course in all the three topics, as required in textile engineering or industrial engineering.\n\nOrganised into 10 chapters, the book discusses three different courses namely statistics, the design of experiments and quality control. Chapter 1 is the introductory chapter which describes the importance of statistical methods, the design of experiments and statistical quality control. Chapters 2-6 deal with statistical methods including basic concepts of probability theory, descriptive statistics, statistical inference, statistical test of hypothesis and analysis of correlation and regression.

That same year, a trove of Michael Jackson memorabilia\u2014including his iconic crystal-encrusted white glove\u2014was sold at auction for over $1 million to a guy who was, officially, just the lowly forestry minister of the tiny nation of Equatorial Guinea. And in 2014, Ukrainian revolutionaries raided the palace of their ousted president and found a zoo of peacocks, gilded toilets, and a floating restaurant modeled after a Spanish galleon. Unlikely as it might seem, there is a thread connecting these events, and Rachel Maddow follows it to its crooked source: the unimaginably lucrative and equally corrupting oil and gas industry. With her trademark black humor, Maddow takes us on a switchback journey around the globe, revealing the greed and incompetence of Big Oil and Gas along the way, and drawing a surprising conclusion about why the Russian government hacked the 2016 U.S. election. She deftly shows how Russia\u2019s rich reserves of crude have, paradoxically, stunted its growth, forcing Putin to maintain his power by spreading Russia\u2019s rot into its rivals, its neighbors, the West\u2019s most important alliances, and the United States. Chevron, BP, and a host of other industry players get their star turn, most notably ExxonMobil and the deceptively well-behaved Rex Tillerson. The oil and gas industry has weakened democracies in developed and developing countries, fouled oceans and rivers, and propped up authoritarian thieves and killers. But being outraged at it is, according to Maddow, \u201clike being indignant when a lion takes down and eats a gazelle. You can\u2019t really blame the lion.

By assigning rational value to other values besides money--things like community, purpose, and sustainability--we can refocus our energies to build a society that's generous, fair, and ready for the future. By recalibrating our definition of value, a world of scarcity can become a world of abundance.\r\n\r\nHopeful but firmly grounded, full of concrete solutions and bursting with creativity, This Could Be Our Future brilliantly dissects the world we live in and shows us a road map to the world we are capable of making.", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Economics", "slug": "economics"}, {"name": "Business", "slug": "business"}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}, {"name": "Politics", "slug": "politics"}, {"name": "Sociology", "slug": "sociology"}, {"name": "Technology", "slug": "technology"}, {"name": "Social Science", "slug": "social-science"}, {"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}, {"name": "Audiobook", "slug": "audiobook"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44525559-this-could-be-our-future", "pages_n": 304, "pub_time": "2019-10-29T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": null, "book_publisher": "Viking", "book_isbn": "0525560823", "book_isbn13": "9780525560821", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "18344485", "name": "Yancey Strickler", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.09, "rating_count": 615, "rating_count_dist": [3, 24, 113, 247, 228], "reviews_count": 85}, "series": [], "links": null}

The stakes could not be higher: a global architecture of behavior modification threatens human nature in the twenty-first century just as industrial capitalism disfigured the natural world in the twentieth.Zuboff vividly brings to life the consequences as surveillance capitalism advances from Silicon Valley into every economic sector. Vast wealth and power are accumulated in ominous new \"behavioral futures markets,\" where predictions about our behavior are bought and sold, and the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new \"means of behavioral modification.\"The threat has shifted from a totalitarian Big Brother state to a ubiquitous digital architecture: a \"Big Other\" operating in the interests of surveillance capital. Here is the crucible of an unprecedented form of power marked by extreme concentrations of knowledge and free from democratic oversight. Zuboff's comprehensive and moving analysis lays bare the threats to twenty-first century society: a controlled \"hive\" of total connection that seduces with promises of total certainty for maximum profit--at the expense of democracy, freedom, and our human future.With little resistance from law or society, surveillance capitalism is on the verge of dominating the social order and shaping the digital future--if we let it.\r\n\r\nTable of contents\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n1.

But one rogue researcher looked at the data and decided everyone was wrong. Franz Boas was the very image of a mad scientist: a wild-haired immigrant with a thick German accent. By the 1920s he was also the foundational thinker and public face of a new school of thought at Columbia University called cultural anthropology. He proposed that cultures did not exist on a continuum from primitive to advanced. Instead, every society solves the same basic problems--from childrearing to how to live well--with its own set of rules, beliefs, and taboos.\r\n\r\nBoas's students were some of the century's intellectual stars: Margaret Mead, the outspoken field researcher whose Coming of Age in Samoa is one of the most widely read works of social science of all time; Ruth Benedict, the great love of Mead's life, whose research shaped post-Second World War Japan; Ella Deloria, the Dakota Sioux activist who preserved the traditions of Native Americans of the Great Plains; and Zora Neale Hurston, whose studies under Boas fed directly into her now-classic novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God. Together, they mapped vanishing civilizations from the Arctic to the South Pacific and overturned the relationship between biology and behavior. Their work reshaped how we think of women and men, normalcy and deviance, and re-created our place in a world of many cultures and value systems.\r\n\r\n Gods of the Upper Air is a page-turning narrative of radical ideas and adventurous lives, a history rich in scandal, romance, and rivalry, and a genesis story of the fluid conceptions of identity that define our present moment.", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Anthropology", "slug": "anthropology"}, {"name": "Biography", "slug": "biography"}, {"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}, {"name": "Sociology", "slug": "sociology"}, {"name": "Race", "slug": "race"}, {"name": "Politics", "slug": "politics"}, {"name": "Feminism", "slug": "feminism"}, {"name": "Social Science", "slug": "social-science"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42951225-gods-of-the-upper-air", "pages_n": 448, "pub_time": "2019-08-06T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2019-08-06T07:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Doubleday Books", "book_isbn": "0385542194", "book_isbn13": "9780385542197", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "1315111", "name": "Charles  King", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.29, "rating_count": 1718, "rating_count_dist": [7, 35, 208, 672, 796], "reviews_count": 285}, "series": [], "links": null}

Some years before that, in 1977, Eco published a little book for his students, \"How to Write a Thesis,\" in which he offered useful advice on all the steps involved in researching and writing a thesis -- from choosing a topic to organizing a work schedule to writing the final draft. Now in its twenty-third edition in Italy and translated into seventeen languages, \"How to Write a Thesis \"has become a classic. Remarkably, this is its first, long overdue publication in English.\r\n\r\nEco's approach is anything but dry and academic. He not only offers practical advice but also considers larger questions about the value of the thesis-writing exercise. \"How to Write a Thesis\" is unlike any other writing manual. It reads like a novel. It is opinionated. It is frequently irreverent, sometimes polemical, and often hilarious. Eco advises students how to avoid \"thesis neurosis\" and he answers the important question \"Must You Read Books?\" He reminds students \"You are not Proust\" and \"Write everything that comes into your head, but only in the first draft.\" Of course, there was no Internet in 1977, but Eco's index card research system offers important lessons about critical thinking and information curating for students of today who may be burdened by Big Data.\r\n\r\n\"How to Write a Thesis\" belongs on the bookshelves of students, teachers, writers, and Eco fans everywhere. Already a classic, it would fit nicely between two other classics: \"Strunk and White\" and \"The Name of the Rose.\"\r\n\r\nThis MIT Press edition will be available in three different cover colors.\r\n\r\nContents\r\nThe Definition and Purpose of a Thesis\r\nChoosing the Topic\r\nConducting Research\r\nThe Work Plan and the Index Cards\r\nWriting the Thesis\r\nThe Final Draft", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Writing", "slug": "writing"}, {"name": "Reference", "slug": "reference"}, {"name": "Education", "slug": "education"}, {"name": "Research", "slug": "research"}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}, {"name": "Academia", "slug": "academia"}, {"name": "Academic", "slug": "academic"}, {"name": "Essays", "slug": "essays"}, {"name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23461426-how-to-write-a-thesis", "pages_n": 229, "pub_time": "2015-02-27T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1977-01-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "MIT Press", "book_isbn": "0262527138", "book_isbn13": "9780262527132", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "1730", "name": "Umberto Eco", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [{"id": "9805953", "name": "Caterina Mongiat Farina", "role": "Translator"}, {"id": "9805954", "name": "Geoff Farina", "role": "Translator"}, {"id": "5296430", "name": "Francesco Erspamer", "role": "Introduction"}], "stats": {"rating_avg": 3.92, "rating_count": 3604, "rating_count_dist": [29, 165, 902, 1461, 1047], "reviews_count": 376}, "series": [], "links": null}

But it didn't start out that way. In this thorough account of one of cinema's most lasting works, Michael Kaminski presents the true history of how Star Wars was written, from its beginnings as a science fiction fairy tale to its development over three decades into the epic we now know, chronicling the methods, techniques, thought processes, and struggles of its creator.

Even the reforms that Americans love best have come with costs that are staggeringly high\u2014in wealth, freedom, and social stability\u2014and that have been spread unevenly among classes and generations. Caldwell reveals the real political turning points of the past half century, taking readers on a roller-coaster ride through Playboy magazine, affirmative action, CB radio, leveraged buyouts, iPhones, Oxycontin, Black Lives Matter, and internet cookies. In doing so, he shows that attempts to redress the injustices of the past have left Americans living under two different ideas of what it means to play by the rules. Essential, timely, hard to put down, The Age of Entitlement is a brilliant and ambitious argument about how the reforms of the past fifty years gave the country two incompatible political systems\u2014and drove it toward conflict.", "genres": [{"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Politics", "slug": "politics"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Cultural", "slug": "cultural"}, {"name": "American History", "slug": "american-history"}, {"name": "Sociology", "slug": "sociology"}, {"name": "American", "slug": "american"}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}, {"name": "Political Science", "slug": "political-science"}, {"name": "Economics", "slug": "economics"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52419341-the-age-of-entitlement", "pages_n": 352, "pub_time": "2020-01-21T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2020-01-21T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Simon  Schuster", "book_isbn": "1501106899", "book_isbn13": "9781501106897", "book_language": null, "primary_contributor": {"id": "24398", "name": "Christopher Caldwell", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 3.98, "rating_count": 1021, "rating_count_dist": [40, 59, 167, 368, 387], "reviews_count": 177}, "series": [], "links": null}

This occurs globally across all organizations, government and in the home. This book creates an acute awareness of what has lead us down this path, and provides the solution for a simple, but also challenging mindset change that is necessary for society to prosper. Once accomplished, it will lead to greater happiness and success for all.  Traditional values such as honesty, trust, accountability, responsibility, altruism, and integrity are the foundation of moral wealth and prosperity; yet such traits are not integrated into our thoughts and actions. The Give a Damn philosophy articulates how the development of our society in combination with our selfish thoughts and actions towards others degrade society. It involves a high commitment to putting the needs of others before those of self in both big and small ways to improve interpersonal relationships and help motivate and inspire positivity. The Give a Damn theme is a program that provides offerings that each individual, employee, CEO, and all organizations can implement, leading to greater success, happiness and clarity in life and business.

Now, in his third book in this monumental trilogy, he reveals how successful nations recover from crises while adopting selective changes -- a coping mechanism more commonly associated with individuals recovering from personal crises.Diamond compares how six countries have survived recent upheavals -- ranging from the forced opening of Japan by U.S. Commodore Perry's fleet, to the Soviet Union's attack on Finland, to a murderous coup or countercoup in Chile and Indonesia, to the transformations of Germany and Australia after World War Two. Because Diamond has lived and spoken the language in five of these six countries, he can present gut-wrenching histories experienced firsthand. These nations coped, to varying degrees, through mechanisms such as acknowledgment of responsibility, painfully honest self-appraisal, and learning from models of other nations. Looking to the future, Diamond examines whether the United States, Japan, and the whole world are successfully coping with the grave crises they currently face. Can we learn from lessons of the past? \r\nAdding a psychological dimension to the in-depth history, geography, biology, and anthropology that mark all of Diamond's books, Upheaval reveals factors influencing how both whole nations and individual people can respond to big challenges.

Most of us take for granted the features of our modern society, from air travel and telecommunications to literacy and obesity. Yet for nearly all of its six million years of existence, human society had none of these things. While the gulf that divides us from our primitive ancestors may seem unbridgeably wide, we can glimpse much of our former lifestyle in those largely traditional societies still or recently in existence. Societies like those of the New Guinea Highlanders remind us that it was only yesterday\u2014in evolutionary time\u2014when everything changed and that we moderns still possess bodies and social practices often better adapted to traditional than to modern conditions.The World Until Yesterday provides a mesmerizing firsthand picture of the human past as it had been for millions of years\u2014a past that has mostly vanished\u2014and considers what the differences between that past and our present mean for our lives today.\r\n\r\nThis is Jared Diamond\u2019s most personal book to date, as he draws extensively from his decades of field work in the Pacific islands, as well as evidence from Inuit, Amazonian Indians, Kalahari San people, and others. Diamond doesn\u2019t romanticize traditional societies\u2014after all, we are shocked by some of their practices\u2014but he finds that their solutions to universal human problems such as child rearing, elder care, dispute resolution, risk, and physical fitness have much to teach us.

Its study has been neglected for many years, either because it was thought to be too difficult, or because the relevant evidence was thought to be poor.

Adducing data to show that consciousness is associated with a kind of global workplace in the nervous system, and that several brain structures are known to behave in accordance with his theory, Baars helps to clarify many difficult problems.", "genres": [{"name": "Psychology", "slug": "psychology"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1148175.A_Cognitive_Theory_Of_Consciousness", "pages_n": null, "pub_time": "1993-07-30T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1989-02-24T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Cambridge University Press", "book_isbn": "0521427436", "book_isbn13": "9780521427432", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "540852", "name": "Bernard J.

Sagmeister once scratched words into his skin for his own lecture poster at Cranbrook, and this is the book version--sometimes enlightening, sometimes embarrassing, always self-conscious, and ultimately touching. The story is a conversation between Peter Hall's text and Sagmeister's handwritten commentary, a perfect and believable device for an absorbing dialogue. Self-indulgent as Made You Look may be, Sagmeister lays himself open with idealism, irony, and humor, creating one of the most moving books about design. --Juliette Cezzar ", "genres": [{"name": "Design", "slug": "design"}, {"name": "Art", "slug": "art"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Art Design", "slug": "art-design"}, {"name": "Biography", "slug": "biography"}, {"name": "Graphic Novels", "slug": "graphic-novels"}, {"name": "Collections", "slug": "collections"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/426827.Sagmeister", "pages_n": 292, "pub_time": "2001-03-01T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2001-03-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Thames & Hudson", "book_isbn": "1861542747", "book_isbn13": "9781861542748", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "240651", "name": "Stefan Sagmeister", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [{"id": "58965", "name": "Peter Hall", "role": "Author"}], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.29, "rating_count": 1019, "rating_count_dist": [15, 24, 140, 307, 533], "reviews_count": 35}, "series": [], "links": null}

During this time he has broken into a Space Station with a Swiss army knife, disposed of a live snake while piloting a plane, and been temporarily blinded while clinging to the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft. The secret to Col. Hadfield's success-and survival-is an unconventional philosophy he learned at NASA: prepare for the worst-and enjoy every moment of it. In An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth, Col. Hadfield takes readers deep into his years of training and space exploration to show how to make the impossible possible. Through eye-opening, entertaining stories filled with the adrenaline of launch, the mesmerizing wonder of spacewalks, and the measured, calm responses mandated by crises, he explains how conventional wisdom can get in the way of achievement-and happiness. His own extraordinary education in space has taught him some counterintuitive lessons: don't visualize success, do care what others think, and always sweat the small stuff. You might never be able to build a robot, pilot a spacecraft, make a music video or perform basic surgery in zero gravity like Col. Hadfield. But his vivid and refreshing insights will teach you how to think like an astronaut, and will change, completely, the way you view life on Earth-especially your own.", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}, {"name": "Biography", "slug": "biography"}, {"name": "Space", "slug": "space"}, {"name": "Memoir", "slug": "memoir"}, {"name": "Autobiography", "slug": "autobiography"}, {"name": "Biography Memoir", "slug": "biography-memoir"}, {"name": "Audiobook", "slug": "audiobook"}, {"name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}, {"name": "Self Help", "slug": "self-help"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18170143-an-astronaut-s-guide-to-life-on-earth", "pages_n": 295, "pub_time": "2013-10-29T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2013-10-29T07:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Little, Brown and Company", "book_isbn": "0316253014", "book_isbn13": "9780316253017", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "1136925", "name": "Chris Hadfield", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.15, "rating_count": 55076, "rating_count_dist": [1289, 1928, 7958, 20052, 23849], "reviews_count": 4609}, "series": [], "links": null}

You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story. \r\n\r\nTremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life \u2014 from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy \u2014 to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction \u2014 to the philosopher who becomes a pirate \u2014 to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph \u2014 to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad \u2014 to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels. \r\n\r\nYou must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions.\r\n\r\nThis is a mystery story, not about the murder \u2014 and rebirth \u2014 of man\u2019s spirit.

Rich Stevens describes more than 200 system calls and functions; since he believes the best way to learn code is to read code, a brief example accompanies each description.Building upon information presented in the first 15 chapters, the author offers chapter-long examples teaching you how to create a database library, a PostScript printer driver, a modem dialer, and a program that runs other programs under a pseudo terminal. To make your analysis and understanding of this code even easier, and to allow you to modify it, all of the code in the book is available via UUNET.A 20-page appendix provides detailed function prototypes for all the UNIX, POSIX, and ANSI C functions that are described in the book, and lists the page on which each prototype function is described in detail.

Never again will you think about thinking the same way.\r\n\r\nMalcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? \r\n\r\nIn Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Psychology", "slug": "psychology"}, {"name": "Business", "slug": "business"}, {"name": "Self Help", "slug": "self-help"}, {"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}, {"name": "Sociology", "slug": "sociology"}, {"name": "Audiobook", "slug": "audiobook"}, {"name": "Personal Development", "slug": "personal-development"}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}, {"name": "Leadership", "slug": "leadership"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40102.Blink", "pages_n": 296, "pub_time": "2007-04-03T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2005-01-11T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Back Bay Books", "book_isbn": "0316010669", "book_isbn13": "9780316010665", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "1439", "name": "Malcolm Gladwell", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [{"id": "141371", "name": "Barry Fox", "role": "Author"}, {"id": "10685078", "name": "Irina Henegar", "role": "Translator"}], "stats": {"rating_avg": 3.95, "rating_count": 553834, "rating_count_dist": [11224, 28469, 120134, 209677, 184330], "reviews_count": 17190}, "series": [], "links": null}

Those days are gone for ever, I am afraid.\u201d When they hear a proposal, which had originated with the Commissioner, that their club consider accepting native members, Mr. Ellis snarls brusquely, \u201cI don\u2019t like niggers, to put it in one word.\u201d Mr. Westfield solemnly maintains that excessive legalism and bureaucratic routine impede the real work of the imperial government in maintaining order and respect for authority. \u201cBritish Raj is finished if you ask me,\u201d he says. John Flory, who works for a timber company, has spent most of his adult life in the Raj; he has grown weary of colonial ways but cannot extricate himself from his situation in Burma. More than the other British residents, he mixes freely with the natives. He is on friendly terms with Dr. Veraswami, an Indian physician; he becomes distinctly uncomfortable when some of his compatriots vent their disdain for Asians. Flory maintains a Burmese mistress, Ma Hla May, with whom he has a certain number of rather perfunctory assignations.", "genres": [{"name": "Fiction", "slug": "fiction"}, {"name": "Classics", "slug": "classics"}, {"name": "Historical Fiction", "slug": "historical-fiction"}, {"name": "Literature", "slug": "literature"}, {"name": "Asia", "slug": "asia"}, {"name": "Travel", "slug": "travel"}, {"name": "Novels", "slug": "novels"}, {"name": "British Literature", "slug": "british-literature"}, {"name": "Historical", "slug": "historical"}, {"name": "20th Century", "slug": "20th-century"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30069506", "pages_n": 350, "pub_time": "2016-03-15T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1934-01-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "", "book_isbn": "9785170969", "book_isbn13": null, "book_language": "Russian", "primary_contributor": {"id": "3706", "name": "George Orwell", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [{"id": "7034668", "name": "\u0414\u0436\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0436 \u041e\u0440\u0443\u044d\u043b\u043b", "role": "Author"}], "stats": {"rating_avg": 3.87, "rating_count": 25029, "rating_count_dist": [237, 1224, 6349, 11007, 6212], "reviews_count": 1637}, "series": [], "links": null}

Until now.In Adrenaline Junkies and Template Zombies, the six principal consultants of The Atlantic Systems Guild present the patterns of behavior they most often observe at the dozens of IT firms they transform each year, around the world.The result is a quick-read guide to identifying nearly ninety typical scenarios, drawing on a combined one-hundred-and-fifty years of project management experience. Project by project, you'll improve the accuracy of your hunches and your ability to act on them. The patterns are presented in an easy-reference format, with names designed to ease communication with your teammates. In just a few words, you can describe what's happening on your project. Citing the patterns of behavior can help you quickly move those above and below you to the next step on your project. You'll find classic patterns such as these:*\tNews Improvement*\tManagement By Mood Ring*\tPiling On*\tRattle Yer Dags*\tNatural Authority*\tFood++*\tFridge Door*\tand more than eighty more!Not every pattern will be evident in your organization, and not every pattern is necessarily good or bad. However, you'll find many patterns that will apply to your current and future assignments, even in the most ambiguous circumstances.

With the ability to understand how things worked or might work at a very deep level, he linked his own mathematics to engineering and provided basic ideas for the design of all sorts of inventions, from radar to communications networks to computers to artificial limbs. Wiener had an abiding concern about the ethics guiding applications of theories he and other scientists developed. Years after he died, the manuscript for this book was discovered among his papers. The world of science has changed greatly since Wiener's day, and much of the change has been in the direction he warned against. Now published for the first time, this book can be read as a salutary corrective from the past and a chance to rethink the components of an environment that encourages inventiveness.Wiener provides an engagingly written insider's understanding of the history of discovery and invention, emphasizing the historical circumstances that foster innovations and allow their application. His message is that truly original ideas cannot be produced on an assembly line, and that their consequences are often felt only at distant times and places. The intellectual and technological environment has to be right before the idea can blossom. The best course for society is to encourage the best minds to pursue the most interesting topics, and to reward them for the insights they produce. Wiener's comments on the problem of secrecy and the importance of the free-lance scientist are particularly pertinent today.\n\nSteve Heims provides a brief history of Wiener's literary output and reviews his contributions to the field of invention and discovery. In addition, Heims suggests significant ways in which Wiener's ideas still apply to dilemmas facing the scientific and engineering communities of the 1990s.", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/749518.Invention", "pages_n": 186, "pub_time": "1994-08-22T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "1993-01-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "MIT Press", "book_isbn": "0262731118", "book_isbn13": "9780262731119", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "88990", "name": "Norbert Wiener", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 3.74, "rating_count": 31, "rating_count_dist": [0, 1, 12, 12, 6], "reviews_count": 1}, "series": [], "links": null}

Originally published in 1970, the book was one of the first to focus on the processes and meaning of consumption in contemporary culture. At a time when others were fixated with the production process, Baudrillard could be found making the case that consumption is now the axis of culture. He demonstrates how consumption is related to the goal of economic growth and he maps out a social theory of consumption. Many of the themes that would later make Baudrillard famous are sketched out here for the first time. In particular, concepts of simulation and the simulacrum receive their earliest systematic treatment.\r\n\r\nWritten at a time when Baudrillard was moving away from both Marxism and institutional sociology, the book is more systematic than his later works. He is still pursuing the task of locating consumption in culture and society. So the reader will find here his most organized discussion of mass media culture, the meaning of leisure and anomie in affluent society. There is also a fascinating chapter on the body which shows yet again Baudrillard's extraordinary prescience in flagging the importance of vital subjects in contemporary culture long before his colleagues.\r\n\r\nBaudrillard is widely acclaimed as a key thinker in sociology, communication and cultural studies. This book makes available to English-speaking readers one of his most important works.

The unstated objective of his lecture (\u201cExistentialism Is a Humanism\u201d) was to expound his philosophy as a form of \u201cexistentialism,\u201d a term much bandied about at the time. Sartre asserted that existentialism was essentially a doctrine for philosophers, though, ironically, he was about to make it accessible to a general audience. The published text of his lecture quickly became one of the bibles of existentialism and made Sartre an international celebrity.\r\n\r\nThe idea of freedom occupies the center of Sartre\u2019s doctrine. Man, born into an empty, godless universe, is nothing to begin with. He creates his essence\u2014his self, his being\u2014through the choices he freely makes (\u201cexistence precedes essence\u201d). Were it not for the contingency of his death, he would never end. Choosing to be this or that is to affirm the value of what we choose.

Instead of writing code in a general-purpose programming language, you can first build a custom language tailored to make you efficient in a particular domain. The key is understanding the common patterns found across language implementations. Language Design Patterns identifies and condenses the most common design patterns, providing sample implementations of each. The pattern implementations use Java, but the patterns themselves are completely general. Some of the implementations use the well-known ANTLR parser generator, so readers will find this book an excellent source of ANTLR examples as well. But this book will benefit anyone interested in implementing languages, regardless of their tool of choice. Other language implementation books focus on compilers, which you rarely need in your daily life. Instead, Language Design Patterns shows you patterns you can use for all kinds of language applications. You'll learn to create configuration file readers, data readers, model-driven code generators, source-to-source translators, source analyzers, and interpreters.

No longer is execution speed the sole criterion for judging compiled code. Today, code might be judged on how small it is, how much power it consumes, how well it compresses, or how many page faults it generates. In this evolving environment, the task of building a successful compiler relies upon the compiler writer's ability to balance and blend algorithms, engineering insights, and careful planning. Today's compiler writer must choose a path through a design space that is filled with diverse alternatives, each with distinct costs, advantages, and complexities.\n\nEngineering a Compiler explores this design space by presenting some of the ways these problems have been solved, and the constraints that made each of those solutions attractive. By understanding the parameters of the problem and their impact on compiler design, the authors hope to convey both the depth of the problems and the breadth of possible solutions. Their goal is to cover a broad enough selection of material to show readers that real tradeoffs exist, and that the impact of those choices can be both subtle and far-reaching.\n\nAuthors Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon convey both the art and the science of compiler construction and show best practice algorithms for the major passes of a compiler.

The author uses SAS-IML and Stata to implement many of the techniques in the examples.\n\n\n\nAccessible to a broad audience, this book explains how to model measurement error, the effects of ignoring it, and how to correct for it.

This is why it is imperative to build systems that are flexible and can adapt to changing requirements, both expected and (more often) unexpected. That is why I've written this book.\r\n\r\nFrom 2009 to 2014, I traveled the world working with software developers, both individually and in teams, to improve their craft. Primarily, I did this through a training workshop format called coderetreat. Over those years, I had the opportunity to watch 1000's of pairs of programmers work on exactly the same system, Conway's Game of Life. As time progressed, I began to see patterns arise. I noticed common techniques and designs that spanned languages and companies and crossed national borders.\r\n\r\nAs co-founder and a facilitator of coderetreat workshops, I had the unique opportunity to provide feedback, both direct and through questions, on improving the act of writing adaptable, simple code. Through the day, we worked on improving our ability to make good choices around the minute-by-minute decisions made while writing code.\r\n\r\nThis book is about those things I learned from watching these 1000's of pairs working on the same problem. It contains a large part of the feedback that I provide during a typical coderetreat. The primary focus is on the thought process behind refactoring, and how that is influenced by the 4 rules of simple design.\r\n\r\nThis book is not about Conway's Game of Life.

Inspired by forensic psychology methods, you'll learn strategies to predict the future of your codebase, assess refactoring direction, and understand how your team influences the design. With its unique blend of forensic psychology and code analysis, this book arms you with the strategies you need, no matter what programming language you use.\r\n\r\nSoftware is a living entity that's constantly changing. To understand software systems, we need to know where they came from and how they evolved. By mining commit data and analyzing the history of your code, you can start fixes ahead of time to eliminate broken designs, maintenance issues, and team productivity bottlenecks. \r\n\r\nIn this book, you'll learn forensic psychology techniques to successfully maintain your software. You'll create a geographic profile from your commit data to find hotspots, and apply temporal coupling concepts to uncover hidden relationships between unrelated areas in your code. You'll also measure the effectiveness of your code improvements. You'll learn how to apply these techniques on projects both large and small. For small projects, you'll get new insights into your design and how well the code fits your ideas. For large projects, you'll identify the good and the fragile parts.\r\n\r\nLarge-scale development is also a social activity, and the team's dynamics influence code quality. That's why this book shows you how to uncover social biases when analyzing the evolution of your system. You'll use commit messages as eyewitness accounts to what is really happening in your code. Finally, you'll put it all together by tracking organizational problems in the code and finding out how to fix them.

In contrast, Swarm Intelligence argues that human intelligence derives from the interactions of individuals in a social world and further, that this model of intelligence can be effectively applied to artificially intelligent systems.\r\n\r\nThe authors first present the foundations of this new approach through an extensive review of the critical literature in social psychology, cognitive science, and evolutionary computation. They then show in detail how these theories and models apply to a new computational intelligence methodology - particle swarms - which focuses on adaptation as the key behavior of intelligent systems. Drilling down still further, the authors describe the practical benefits of applying particle swarm optimization to a range of engineering problems. Developed by the authors, this algorithm is an extension of cellular automata and provides a powerful optimization, learning, and problem solving method.\r\n\r\nThis important book presents valuable new insights by exploring the boundaries shared by cognitive science, social psychology, artificial life,  artificial intelligence, and evolutionary computation and by applying these insights to the solving of difficult engineering problems. Researchers and graduate students in any of these disciplines will find the material intriguing, provocative, and revealing as will the curious and savvy computing professional.\r\n\r\n* Places particle swarms within the larger context of intelligent adaptive behavior and evolutionary computation.\r\n\r\n* Describes recent results of experiments with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.\r\n\r\n* Includes a basic overview of statistics to ensure readers can properly analyze the results of their own experiments using the algorithm.\r\n\r\n* Support software which can be downloaded from the publishers website, includes a Java PSO applet, C and Visual Basic source code.", "genres": [{"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}, {"name": "Computer Science", "slug": "computer-science"}, {"name": "Artificial Intelligence", "slug": "artificial-intelligence"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Technology", "slug": "technology"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387984.Swarm_Intelligence", "pages_n": 512, "pub_time": "2001-03-26T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2001-03-26T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Morgan Kaufmann Publishers", "book_isbn": "1558605959", "book_isbn13": "9781558605954", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "220574", "name": "James Kennedy", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [{"id": "220575", "name": "Russell C.

This fascinating exploration of how information systems emerge takes readers on a provocative journey through the history of the information age.\r\n\r\nToday's \"information explosion\" may seem like an acutely modern phenomenon, but we are not the first generation--nor even the first species--to wrestle with the problem of information overload. Long before the advent of computers, human beings were collecting, storing, and organizing information: from Ice Age taxonomies to Sumerian archives, Greek libraries to Dark Age monasteries.\r\n\r\nToday, we stand at a precipice, as our old systems struggle to cope with what designer Richard Saul Wurman called a \"tsunami of data.\" With some historical perspective, however, we can begin to understand our predicament not just as the result of technological change, but as the latest chapter in an ancient story that we are only beginning to understand.\r\n\r\nSpanning disciplines from evolutionary theory and cultural anthropology to the history of books, libraries, and computer science, writer and information architect Alex Wright weaves an intriguing narrative that connects such seemingly far-flung topics as insect colonies, Stone Age jewelry, medieval monasteries, Renaissance encyclopedias, early computer networks, and the World Wide Web.

From the archives of Sumeria to the Library of Alexandria, humanity has long wrestled with information overload and management of intellectual output. Revived during the Renaissance and picking up pace in the Enlightenment, the dream grew and by the late nineteenth century was embraced by a number of visionaries who felt that at long last it was within their grasp. Among them, Paul Otlet stands out. A librarian by training, he worked at expanding the potential of the catalogue card -- the world's first information chip. From there followed universal libraries and reading rooms, connecting his native Belgium to the world -- by means of vast collections of cards that brought together everything that had ever been put to paper. Recognizing that the rapid acceleration of technology was transforming the world's intellectual landscape, Otlet devoted himself to creating a universal bibliography of all published knowledge. Ultimately totaling more than 12 million individual entries, it would evolve into the Mundaneum, a vast \"city of knowledge\" that opened its doors to the public in 1921. By 1934, Otlet had drawn up plans for a network of \"electric telescopes\" that would allow people everywhere to search through books, newspapers, photographs, and recordings, all linked together in what he termed a reseau mondial: a worldwide web. It all seemed possible, almost until the moment when the Nazis marched into Brussels and carted it all away. In Cataloging the World, Alex Wright places Otlet in the long continuum of visionaries and pioneers who have dreamed of unifying the world's knowledge, from H.G. Wells and Melvil Dewey to Ted Nelson and Steve Jobs. And while history has passed Otlet by, Wright shows that his legacy persists in today's networked age, where Internet corporations like Google and Twitter play much the same role that Otlet envisioned for the Mundaneum -- as the gathering and distribution channels for the world's intellectual output. In this sense, Cataloging the World is more than just the story of a failed entrepreneur; it is an ongoing story of a powerful idea that has captivated humanity from time immemorial, and that continues to inspire many of us in today's digital age.", "genres": [{"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "History", "slug": "history"}, {"name": "Biography", "slug": "biography"}, {"name": "Library Science", "slug": "library-science"}, {"name": "Librarianship", "slug": "librarianship"}, {"name": "Technology", "slug": "technology"}, {"name": "Information Science", "slug": "information-science"}, {"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}, {"name": "Books About Books", "slug": "books-about-books"}, {"name": "Buisness", "slug": "buisness"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18699137-cataloging-the-world", "pages_n": 360, "pub_time": "2014-06-04T07:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2014-01-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Oxford University Press, USA", "book_isbn": "0199931410", "book_isbn13": "9780199931415", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "397483", "name": "Alex Wright", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 3.79, "rating_count": 191, "rating_count_dist": [2, 18, 44, 82, 45], "reviews_count": 34}, "series": [], "links": null}

These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way.

In 1962, he won the Nobel Prize in Medicine, along with J. D. Watson and M. H. F. Wilkins, for breakthrough studies on the molecular structure of DNA. Just four years later he published this collection of popular lectures in which he explained the importance of this discovery in layperson\u2019s terms and emphasized its wide-reaching implications. Though written forty years ago, this succinct, lucid explication of the scientific facts remains the perfect primer for the lay reader curious about the ongoing biological revolution and is amazingly prescient in light of recent developments.Beginning with a critique of \"vitalism,\" the notion that an intangible life force beyond the grasp of biology distinguishes living organisms from inanimate things, Crick argues that in all likelihood the complex mechanisms of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis fully explain the phenomenon of life. While admitting that many details are uncertain and much remains unknown about the origins of life, he nonetheless maintains that chance mutations over time, in conjunction with the law of natural selection, offer the most rational explanation of the evolution of life on earth from inorganic precursors. Although few speak of vitalism today, the controversy that Crick addresses is still with us in the form of intelligent design, which suggests that biochemistry and evolution alone do not sufficiently explain the uniqueness of life.In his second lecture Crick explores the borderline between the organic and inorganic, presenting an elegantly clear description of DNA\u2019s basic structure and function in relation to RNA and myriad enzymes.In the final lecture, \"The Prospect Before Us,\" he anticipates events and trends that have in fact come to pass in the past four decades: the increasing use of computer technology and robotics in mind-brain research, explorations into right-side vs. left-side uses of the brain, controversies surrounding the existence of the soul, the dead end of ESP investigations, and above all the daunting challenges of explaining consciousness in completely scientific terms.Of Molecules and Men is a fascinating, still-very-relevant discussion of many crucially important issues in life science.", "genres": [{"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}, {"name": "Biology", "slug": "biology"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Chemistry", "slug": "chemistry"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/410976.Of_Molecules_and_Men", "pages_n": 99, "pub_time": "2004-04-01T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2004-04-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Prometheus Books", "book_isbn": "1591021855", "book_isbn13": "9781591021858", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "218573", "name": "Francis Crick", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [], "stats": {"rating_avg": 3.69, "rating_count": 51, "rating_count_dist": [3, 3, 12, 22, 11], "reviews_count": 8}, "series": [], "links": null}

Taking a broad, applications-based approach, Sedgewick and Wayne teach through important examples from science, mathematics, engineering, finance, and commercial computing. The book demystifies computation, explains its intellectual underpinnings, and covers the essential elements of programming and computational problem solving in today's environments. The authors begin by introducing basic programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, and I/O. Next, they turn to functions, introducing key modular programming concepts, including components and reuse. They present a modern introduction to object-oriented programming, covering current programming paradigms and approaches to data abstraction. Building on this foundation, Sedgewick and Wayne widen their focus to the broader discipline of computer science. They introduce classical sorting and searching algorithms, fundamental data structures and their application, and scientific techniques for assessing an implementation's performance. Using abstract models, readers learn to answer basic questions about computation, gaining insight for practical application. Finally, the authors show how machine architecture links the theory of computing to real computers, and to the field's history and evolution. For each concept, the authors present all the information readers need to build confidence, together with examples that solve intriguing problems. Each chapter contains question-and-answer sections, self-study drills, and challenging problems that demand creative solutions.

Many still vividly remember exactly where they were and what they were doing when they heard about the tragedy. In The Challenger Launch Decision, Diane Vaughan recreates the steps leading up to that fateful decision, contradicting conventional interpretations to prove that what occurred at NASA was not skulduggery or misconduct but a disastrous mistake.Journalists and investigators have historically cited production problems and managerial wrong-doing as the reasons behind the disaster. The Presidential Commission uncovered a flawed decision-making process at the space agency as well, citing a well-documented history of problems with the O-ring and a dramatic last-minute protest by engineers over the Solid Rocket Boosters as evidence of managerial neglect.Why did NASA managers, who not only had all the information prior to the launch but also were warned against it, decide to proceed? In retelling how the decision unfolded through the eyes of the managers and the engineers, Vaughan uncovers an incremental descent into poor judgment, supported by a culture of high-risk technology. She reveals how and why NASA insiders, when repeatedly faced with evidence that something was wrong, normalized the deviance so that it became acceptable to them.No safety rules were broken. No single individual was at fault. Instead, the cause of the disaster is a story not of evil but of the banality of organizational life.

The fiery destruction of Challenger on live television moments after launch remains an indelible image in the nation\u2019s collective memory.   In Truth, Lies, and O-Rings, McDonald, a skilled engineer and executive, relives the tragedy from where he stood at Launch Control Center.

The space shuttle Columbia disintegrated 37 miles above Texas, seven brave astronauts were killed and America's space program, always an eyeblink from disaster, suffered its second catastrophic in-flight failure. Unlike the Challenger disaster 17 years earlier, Columbia's destruction left the nation one failure away from the potential abandonment of human space exploration. Media coverage in the immediate aftermath focused on the possible cause of the disaster, and on the nation's grief. But the full human story, and the shocking details of NASA's crucial mistakes, have never been told -- until now.Based on dozens of exclusive interviews, never-before-published documents and recordings of key meetings obtained by the authors, \"Comm Check\" takes the reader inside the conference rooms and offices where NASA's best and brightest managed the nation's multi-billion-dollar shuttle program -- and where they failed to recognize the signs of an impending disaster. It is the story of a space program pushed to the brink of failure by relentless political pressure, shrinking budgets and flawed decision making. The independent investigation into the disaster uncovered why Columbia broke apart in the sky above Texas. \"Comm Check\" brings that story to life with the human drama behind the tragedy.\r\n\r\nMichael Cabbage and William Harwood, two of America's most respected space journalists, are veterans of all but a handful of NASA's 113 shuttle missions.

He also crystallized one of the most important debates of our time: As we enjoy the Net\u2019s bounties, are we sacrificing our ability to read and think deeply?\r\n\r\nNow, Carr expands his argument into the most compelling exploration of the Internet\u2019s intellectual and cultural consequences yet published. As he describes how human thought has been shaped through the centuries by \u201ctools of the mind\u201d\u2014from the alphabet to maps, to the printing press, the clock, and the computer\u2014Carr interweaves a fascinating account of recent discoveries in neuroscience by such pioneers as Michael Merzenich and Eric Kandel. Our brains, the historical and scientific evidence reveals, change in response to our experiences. The technologies we use to find, store, and share information can literally reroute our neural pathways.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the insights of thinkers from Plato to McLuhan, Carr makes a convincing case that every information technology carries an intellectual ethic\u2014a set of assumptions about the nature of knowledge and intelligence. He explains how the printed book served to focus our attention, promoting deep and creative thought. In stark contrast, the Internet encourages the rapid, distracted sampling of small bits of information from many sources. Its ethic is that of the industrialist, an ethic of speed and efficiency, of optimized production and consumption\u2014and now the Net is remaking us in its own image. We are becoming ever more adept at scanning and skimming, but what we are losing is our capacity for concentration, contemplation, and reflection.\r\n\r\nPart intellectual history, part popular science, and part cultural criticism, The Shallows sparkles with memorable vignettes\u2014Friedrich Nietzsche wrestling with a typewriter, Sigmund Freud dissecting the brains of sea creatures, Nathaniel Hawthorne contemplating the thunderous approach of a steam locomotive\u2014even as it plumbs profound questions about the state of our modern psyche.

Our brains, therefore, are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better - and thus we don't like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness. This is \"the elephant in the brain.\" Such an introspective taboo makes it hard for us to think clearly about our nature and the explanations for our behavior. The aim of this book, then, is to confront our hidden motives directly - to track down the darker, unexamined corners of our psyches and blast them with floodlights. Then, once everything is clearly visible, we can work to better understand ourselves: Why do we laugh? Why are artists sexy? Why do we brag about travel? Why do we prefer to speak rather than listen?\r\n\r\nOur unconscious motives drive more than just our private behavior; they also infect our venerated social institutions such as Art, School, Charity, Medicine, Politics, and Religion. In fact, these institutions are in many ways designed to accommodate our hidden motives, to serve covert agendas alongside their \"official\" ones. The existence of big hidden motives can upend the usual political debates, leading one to question the legitimacy of these social institutions, and of standard policies designed to favor or discourage them. You won't see yourself - or the world - the same after confronting the elephant in the brain.", "genres": [{"name": "Psychology", "slug": "psychology"}, {"name": "Nonfiction", "slug": "non-fiction"}, {"name": "Science", "slug": "science"}, {"name": "Self Help", "slug": "self-help"}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy"}, {"name": "Economics", "slug": "economics"}, {"name": "Audiobook", "slug": "audiobook"}, {"name": "Sociology", "slug": "sociology"}, {"name": "Business", "slug": "business"}, {"name": "Brain", "slug": "brain"}], "web_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820444-the-elephant-in-the-brain", "pages_n": 408, "pub_time": "2017-12-01T08:00:00.000", "pub_first": "2017-12-01T08:00:00.000", "book_publisher": "Oxford University Press", "book_isbn": null, "book_isbn13": "9780190496012", "book_language": "English", "primary_contributor": {"id": "14932232", "name": "Kevin Simler", "role": "Author"}, "secondary_contributors": [{"id": "3865278", "name": "Robin Hanson", "role": "Author"}], "stats": {"rating_avg": 4.02, "rating_count": 5526, "rating_count_dist": [63, 264, 1107, 2177, 1915], "reviews_count": 570}, "series": [], "links": null}

Their \u201creal names\u201d iniative, which makes it easier for stalkers to re-find their victims, is working exactly as designed. Twitter\u2019s toxicity and lack of civil discourse is working exactly as it\u2019s designed to work.\r\n\r\nThe world is working exactly as designed. And it\u2019s not working very well. Which means we need to do a better job of designing it. Design is a craft with an amazing amount of power. The power to choose. The power to influence. As designers, we need to see ourselves as gatekeepers of what we are bringing into the world, and what we choose not to bring into the world. Design is a craft with responsibility. The responsibility to help create a better world for all.\r\n\r\nDesign is also a craft with a lot of blood on its hands. Every cigarette ad is on us. Every gun is on us. Every ballot that a voter cannot understand is on us. Every time social network\u2019s interface allows a stalker to find their victim, that\u2019s on us. The monsters we unleash into the world will carry your name.\r\n\r\nThis book will make you see that design is a political act. What we choose to design is a political act. Who we choose to work for is a political act. Who we choose to work with is a political act. And, most importantly, the people we\u2019ve excluded from these decisions is the biggest (and stupidest) political act we\u2019ve made as a society.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a designer, this book might make you angry. It should make you angry. But it will also give you the tools you need to make better decisions. You will learn how to evaluate the potential benefits and harm of what you\u2019re working on.
